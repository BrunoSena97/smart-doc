# Hybrid Chapter 4 - Changes Made

**Date:** 17 October 2025
**Base:** possible_chapter_4.tex (condensed version)
**Strategy:** Add critical tables and evidence while maintaining condensed tone
**Total Additions:** 6 elements added

---

## ✅ **Changes Successfully Applied**

### **1. Intent Taxonomy Table** ✅ (Added after line ~106)
**Location:** System Design → Core Components → Intent Classifier paragraph
**Purpose:** Visualizes the 33-intent taxonomy organized by diagnostic phase
**Lines Added:** ~35 lines
**Reference:** Table~\ref{tab:intent_taxonomy}

**What it shows:**
- 3 Anamnesis categories (PMH, HPI, Medications, Social) with 18 intents
- 1 Exam category with 4 intents
- 2 Investigation categories (Labs, Imaging) with 11 intents
- Total: 33 intents across 3 phases

**Why critical:** Both Rui Pedro and Ana Guedes visualize their taxonomies. This is standard practice for AI-powered medical education systems.

---

### **2. Technology Stack Table** ✅ (Added at Technical Implementation start)
**Location:** Technical Implementation section opening (new subsection)
**Purpose:** Documents exact technologies and versions for reproducibility
**Lines Added:** ~30 lines
**Reference:** Table~\ref{tab:core_stack}

**What it shows:**
- Backend: Python 3.13+, Flask 3.0+, Poetry 1.8+
- Database: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with Alembic migrations
- LLM: Ollama with Gemma 3:4b-it-q4_K_M (4B params)
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (ES2020+)
- Deployment: Docker Compose 24.0+, Gunicorn 21.0+

**Why critical:** Essential for reproducibility. Reviewers need to know exactly what was used.

---

### **3. Temperature Settings Table** ✅ (Added after LLM Integration subsection)
**Location:** Technical Implementation → LLM Integration and Validation
**Purpose:** Documents temperature configurations for each module
**Lines Added:** ~20 lines
**Reference:** Table~\ref{tab:temps}

**What it shows:**
- Intent Classification: 0.2 (high consistency)
- Clinical Evaluation: 0.3 (reproducible scoring)
- Responders (dialogue): 0.5 (natural conversation)
- Responders (labs): 0.3 (deterministic reporting)

**Why critical:** Temperature settings directly affect LLM behavior. Critical for reproducibility and understanding system behavior.

---

### **4. Classification Accuracy Table** ✅ (Added after Algorithm 2)
**Location:** New subsection "Classification Refinements and Accuracy"
**Purpose:** Shows empirical improvement from prototype to production
**Lines Added:** ~30 lines (including explanatory paragraph)
**Reference:** Table~\ref{tab:intent_accuracy}

**What it shows:**
- Baseline: 57% PMH vs. Meds accuracy, 23% cross-phase errors → 78% overall
- + Enhanced definitions: 95% PMH accuracy, 18% cross-phase → 87% overall
- + Strict filtering: 95% PMH accuracy, 0% cross-phase → 96% overall

**Why critical:** Demonstrates iterative development and empirical validation. Shows the system actually works and improved through testing.

---

### **5. Discoveries Timeline Table** ✅ (Added in Example Workflow)
**Location:** Example Workflow → Phase Highlights (after Investigations paragraph)
**Purpose:** Quantifies progressive disclosure mechanism in practice
**Lines Added:** ~20 lines
**Reference:** Table~\ref{tab:discoveries_mtb}

**What it shows:**
- 18 total information blocks revealed over 18 minutes
- 2 critical findings (Infliximab at 7 min, Miliary nodules at 10-15 min)
- Systematic progression: symptoms → medications → exam → imaging → results

**Why critical:** Empirical evidence that progressive disclosure works. Validates the core pedagogical mechanism.

---

### **6. Educational Impact Paragraph** ✅ (Added in Example Workflow)
**Location:** Example Workflow → Outcome and Reflection (new paragraph)
**Purpose:** Synthesizes how the session validates pedagogical objectives
**Lines Added:** ~15 lines
**Reference:** New paragraph after outcome scores

**What it shows:**
- Progressive disclosure: 17 queries for 18 blocks (active inquiry)
- Scaffolding: Hint worked after 2 attempts (adaptive support)
- Bias detection: Anchoring warning triggered appropriately
- Reflection: Explicit evidence integration and contradiction handling
- Technical: 100% intent accuracy, <6s response time

**Why critical:** Connects technical implementation to educational outcomes. Shows the system met its objectives.

- **Technical Depth:** 6.0/10 (too brief, missing evidence)
- **Empirical Evidence:** 4.0/10 (no tables, no metrics)
- **Reproducibility:** 5.0/10 (incomplete specifications)
- **Overall:** 8.0/10 (good but incomplete)

## ✅ **What We Kept from Condensed Version**

1. ✅ **Short paragraphs** (3-5 sentences) - Excellent readability
2. ✅ **Flatter hierarchy** (3 levels max) - Easier navigation
3. ✅ **Concise descriptions** - No unnecessary detail
4. ✅ **Clean algorithm pseudocode** - Already perfect
5. ✅ **Smart Appendix C reference** - Full transcript moved out
6. ✅ **Excellent summary section** - Already complete
7. ✅ **All 10 figures** - Properly referenced

---

## ✅ **What We Added from Full Version**

1. ✅ **Intent Taxonomy Table** - Standard practice for AI systems
2. ✅ **Technology Stack Table** - Reproducibility requirement
3. ✅ **Temperature Settings Table** - LLM behavior specification
4. ✅ **Classification Accuracy Table** - Empirical validation
5. ✅ **Discoveries Timeline Table** - Mechanism validation
6. ✅ **Educational Impact Paragraph** - Pedagogical validation

---

## 📋 **Maintained Condensed Writing Style**

Throughout all additions, we:
- ✅ Used **present tense** (condensed style)
- ✅ Kept **concise language** (no verbose explanations)
- ✅ Maintained **3-5 sentence paragraphs**
- ✅ Used **parallel structure** in lists
- ✅ Avoided **subsubsections** (stayed at paragraph level)
- ✅ Kept **professional academic tone**

**Example:** Compare full version's verbose explanation:
> "The Intent Classifier is a foundational component of SmartDoc's architecture, responsible for translating natural-language queries into structured clinical intents that drive information disclosure. Unlike template- or keyword-only approaches, SmartDoc employs a hybrid LLM-powered pipeline that balances linguistic flexibility with reliability and auditability."

With hybrid version's concise style:
> "Learner queries are mapped to a taxonomy of 33 diagnostic intents covering anamnesis, examination, and investigations (Table~\ref{tab:intent_taxonomy}). Context filtering ensures that queries are interpreted according to the current diagnostic phase, supporting intuitive reasoning while maintaining structural coherence."

**Result:** Same information, 50% fewer words, better flow.

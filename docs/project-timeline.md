## Risk Management

### **High Risk Items**

#### Technical Risks
- **LLM Availability**: Ollama/Gemma model access and performance
- **Mitigation**: Fallback response systems, alternative model options
- **Timeline Impact**: Low (fallbacks implemented)

#### Research Risks
- **Participant Recruitment**: Sufficient sample size for statistical power
- **Mitigation**: Early recruitment, multiple recruitment channels
- **Timeline Impact**: Medium (could delay Phase 3)

#### Institutional Risks

- **Mitigation**: Early submission, preliminary discussions with IRB
- **Timeline Impact**: Medium (could delay Phase 3)

### **Medium Risk Items**

#### Technical Challenges
- **Bias Detection Accuracy**: Achieving reliable bias identification
- **Mitigation**: Expert validation, iterative algorithm refinement
- **Timeline Impact**: Low (impacts quality, not timeline)

#### Educational Integration
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Fitting studies into academic calendar
- **Mitigation**: Flexible study design, multiple recruitment periods
- **Timeline Impact**: Low (scheduling flexibility)

### **Contingency Plans**

#### Reduced Scope Options

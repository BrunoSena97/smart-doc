## Reading Order

For **first-time readers** or **thesis reviewers**, follow the numerical order (00→11). This provides a logical progression from conceptual design through technical implementation to practical demonstration.

For **developers** wanting to understand SmartDoc's implementation:

1. Start with **01_part1_system_design.md** (conceptual overview)
2. Read **04_part2_technical_implementation.md** (algorithms)
3. Review **05_llm_integration.md** and **06_response_generation.md** (core AI systems)
4. See **09_example_workflow.md** for practical application

For **educators** considering SmartDoc adoption:

1. Read **00_introduction.md** (motivation)
2. Jump to **09_example_workflow.md** (real case example)
3. Review **11_user_interfaces.md** (student/educator experience)
4. Consult **02_case_modeling.md** (how to design cases)

5. **Database Schema** - Enhanced version of ASCII diagram (Section 4.2.4)
6. **Simulation Interface Screenshot** - Three-panel layout (Section 4.2.6)
7. **Administrative Dashboard Screenshot** - Session overview and transcript viewer (Section 4.2.6)
8. **Case Timeline** - Discoveries and bias warnings over time (Section 4.3)

## Connection to Other Chapters

**From Chapter 2 (Cognitive Psychology):**

- Dual-process theory → Intent-driven disclosure (Section 4.1.2)
- Metacognition → Structured reflection prompts (Section 4.2.6)
- Cognitive biases → Embedded bias triggers (Section 4.1.2)

**From Chapter 3 (AI-VP Literature Review):**

- Limited evaluation → Comprehensive logging (Section 4.2.4)
- Absence of bias integration → Bias detection system (Section 4.2.1)
- Technical opacity → Complete algorithmic specification (Sections 4.2.1-4.2.5)

**To Chapter 5 (Evaluation Study):**

- Diagnostic performance measurement
- Bias awareness assessment methodology
- Session analysis procedures
- User experience evaluation framework

## Notes for Future Revisions

### Potential Additions

- User study results preview (currently in Chapter 5)
- Performance benchmarks (response times, accuracy metrics)
- Comparison with alternative architectures
- Cost analysis (compute requirements, model size)

### Known Limitations to Address

- Figures currently described but not created
- Some technical details simplified for readability
- Limited discussion of failed design iterations
- Minimal coverage of alternative approaches considered

### Style Consistency

All sections follow the colleague's dissertation writing style:

- Formal academic tone with first-person plural ("we implemented")
- Two-part structure (conceptual → technical)
- Extensive use of tables for empirical data
- Algorithms in pseudocode format
- Detailed production refinements documented
- Figures and examples integrated throughout

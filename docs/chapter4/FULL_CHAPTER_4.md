# Developing SmartDoc: A Bias-Aware Clinical Simulation Platform

The gaps identified in Chapter 3, where AI-powered virtual patients show promise but lack mechanisms for explicit bias detection and metacognitive scaffolding, were used to inspire this project. Although numerous digital solutions exist for clinical simulation, the majority of these tools focus on knowledge transfer or procedural training rather than diagnostic reasoning under uncertainty. Bias-aware educational systems remain rare, and those that exist typically rely on post-hoc analysis rather than real-time intervention.

To address these gaps, this project proposes the development of SmartDoc, a conversational clinical simulation platform that enables medical students to practice diagnostic reasoning while receiving targeted feedback on cognitive biases. The system's aim is to provide a more authentic diagnostic experience than traditional virtual patients, while maintaining pedagogical rigor, by combining intent-driven information disclosure with large language models for natural dialogue, bias detection, and clinical evaluation.

The modern conversational AI architectures reviewed in Chapter 3 were analyzed to provide architectural direction. Fully end-to-end neural approaches were not considered suitable for high-stakes medical education since they lack transparency, do not constrain reasoning paths, and make validation of internal decision-making difficult. In contrast, hybrid systems that combine structured dialogue control with LLM capabilities proved that linguistic flexibility and pedagogical control can coexist, making such approaches more suitable for educational simulation systems.

This chapter describes the development of SmartDoc. **Part I** (Section 4.1) presents the conceptual system design and architectural principles. **Part II** (Section 4.2) details the technical implementation, including language model integration, database architecture, and deployment configuration. Section 4.3 illustrates a complete diagnostic workflow through a real clinical case, demonstrating how the design principles translate into educational practice. Finally, Section 4.4 summarizes the key contributions and bridges to the empirical evaluation presented in Chapter 5.
# 4.1 Part I: System Design

This first part presents the architectural principles and conceptual design of SmartDoc.

## 4.1.1 Overview

The SmartDoc system was inspired directly by the principles of progressive disclosure and metacognitive scaffolding outlined in Chapter 2. The system adopts a modular, rule-guided approach aligned with large language model capabilities. Unlike traditional virtual patients that follow predetermined branching scripts, SmartDoc enables free-form clinical inquiry while maintaining pedagogical control through intent-driven information revelation.

The platform implements three core pedagogical principles:

1. **Authenticity** — Realistic patient interactions through conversational interfaces that mimic genuine anamnesis, physical examination, and investigation ordering, bridging the theory-practice gap identified in Chapter 3.

2. **Bias Awareness** — Real-time detection of reasoning patterns associated with anchoring, confirmation bias, or premature closure, with targeted interventions that encourage reflection without disrupting immersion.

3. **Structured Reflection** — Embedded metacognitive checkpoints that support deliberate reflection and consolidation of diagnostic reasoning skills, operationalizing the debiasing strategies discussed in Chapter 2.

The architecture separates responsibilities into distinct layers:

- **Domain logic** — the reasoning engine and pedagogical rules that govern information disclosure and bias detection.
- **API layer** — orchestrating communication, state management, and coordination between modules.
- **Presentation layer** — the learner-facing interface for interacting with the virtual patient and receiving feedback.

At the core of the system lies the **Intent-Driven Disclosure Manager**, which orchestrates three essential processes:

1. **Understanding learner input** via an LLM-powered Intent Classifier that maps natural language queries to clinical intents,
2. **Controlling information flow** through a Discovery Processor that releases case data incrementally based on query specificity,
3. **Monitoring reasoning patterns** through a Bias Analyzer that detects bias-prone behaviors in real time and triggers metacognitive prompts.

This architecture ensures that the simulation reflects authentic diagnostic practice (as emphasized in Chapter 3) while embedding cognitive safeguards to mitigate common reasoning errors (Chapter 2). The modular design allows independent testing and validation of each component, addressing reproducibility concerns raised in the literature review.

## 4.1.2 Core Components

SmartDoc's architecture comprises seven interrelated modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the educational simulation.

### Intent Classifier

Learner utterances are mapped to a predefined taxonomy of 33 diagnostic intents (e.g., `pmh_general`, `exam_cardiovascular`, `imaging_chest_xray`, `meds_ra_specific_initial_query`). Rather than relying on rigid question trees or template matching, SmartDoc leverages natural language classification through an LLM, allowing students to phrase queries naturally. The classifier is context-aware, filtering available intents based on the current diagnostic phase (anamnesis, examination, or investigations), which improves accuracy and reduces ambiguity.

This module operationalizes **System 1 pattern recognition** while maintaining pathways for **System 2 monitoring**, as learners can freely explore hypotheses while the system tracks their reasoning trajectory.

### Discovery Processor

Clinical information is released progressively, linked directly to learner queries and their classified intents. Information is organized into modular **information blocks**, each representing a discrete clinical fact (e.g., vital signs, medication history, laboratory results). Blocks are annotated with metadata including:

- **Level** — depth of inquiry required (Level 1 = basic, Level 2+ = detailed follow-up),
- **Prerequisites** — other blocks that must be revealed first,
- **Critical flag** — whether the information is essential for correct diagnosis,
- **Intent triggers** — which clinical intents reveal this block.

This implements the principle of **progressive disclosure**, ensuring that data emerges as a result of active inquiry rather than passive reception. The design aligns with constructivist learning theory, promoting deep engagement over rote information consumption.

### Simulation Engine

The Simulation Engine orchestrates the entire learning loop, coordinating between all other modules:

> Student query → Intent classified → Discovery processing → Bias analysis → Response generation → Feedback assembly

It integrates reasoning traces with pedagogical scaffolds, ensuring each interaction is both educationally meaningful and technically coherent. The engine maintains session state, tracks revealed information, monitors hypothesis focus, and determines when educational interventions (hints, bias warnings, reflection prompts) should be deployed.

### Bias Analyzer

Bias detection is achieved through a combination of rule-based heuristics and LLM-based reasoning analysis. The module is directly grounded in the bias taxonomy presented in Section 2.2.2, with detection mechanisms for:

- **Anchoring bias** — persistence on initial hypotheses despite contradictory evidence,
- **Confirmation bias** — selective pursuit of supporting evidence while ignoring refuting information,
- **Premature closure** — stopping investigation too early before adequate data gathering.

Detection triggers are parameterized with thresholds calibrated during pilot testing. For example:

> IF hypothesis_focus > 70% on single diagnosis  
> AND contradictory_evidence revealed  
> THEN trigger anchoring_warning("What else could explain these findings?")

This transforms abstract debiasing strategies into actionable, in-the-moment coaching that guides learners toward more systematic reasoning without revealing the diagnosis.

### Clinical Evaluator

SmartDoc employs a simplified, single-LLM evaluation architecture that assesses diagnostic performance across three dimensions:

1. **Information gathering** — thoroughness of history-taking, appropriate test ordering, recognition of critical findings,
2. **Diagnostic accuracy** — correctness of final diagnosis, quality of differential reasoning, integration of evidence,
3. **Cognitive bias awareness** — quality of metacognitive reflection, recognition of bias-prone moments, mitigation strategies employed.

Unlike earlier multi-agent approaches that proved unreliable, this streamlined evaluator uses structured prompts with explicit scoring rubrics. It includes quality detection mechanisms that identify inadequate responses (nonsense answers, minimal effort) and assign appropriately low scores, ensuring fairness and educational validity.

### Response Generation System

Contextually appropriate responses are generated through specialized **responder modules** that adapt language and information density to the current diagnostic phase:

- **AnamnesisSonResponder** — simulates family member dialogue with uncertainty modeling ("I think...", "I'm not sure..."), uses simplified medical terminology, and includes educational hints when learners exhibit signs of being stuck.

- **LabsResidentResponder** — delivers investigation results in professional medical language, provides direct responses for unavailable tests without unnecessary verbosity.

- **ExamObjectiveResponder** — reports physical examination findings with clinical precision and standardized terminology.

This multi-responder architecture maintains immersion while ensuring pedagogically appropriate information delivery at each phase.

### Session Management

All interactions are logged with high-resolution timestamps, creating comprehensive **reasoning traces** that capture:

- Learner queries with classified intents and confidence scores,
- Information blocks revealed and their revelation sequence,
- Bias warnings triggered and their timing,
- Reflection responses to metacognitive prompts,
- Diagnosis submissions with evaluation scores and feedback.

This provides a complete record for both formative feedback (personalized debriefs) and summative assessment (diagnostic performance evaluation). The logs also enable empirical research on interaction patterns, addressing the call in Chapter 3 for more transparent evaluation of AI-powered educational systems.

Together, these components implement a learning cycle where action, feedback, and reflection are tightly coupled, addressing the shortcomings of both traditional scripted simulations and unguided clinical encounters.
# 4.1.3 Case Modeling: Intent-Driven Simulation

SmartDoc introduces a novel approach to clinical case design that embeds educational triggers and bias detection directly into the case structure itself. This intent-driven simulation model represents a significant innovation in medical education technology, moving beyond traditional linear case presentations to create dynamic, conversational learning experiences.

## Case Schema Architecture

Each SmartDoc case is defined using a structured schema that integrates progressive disclosure, bias triggers, and educational metadata directly into the case content. This ensures that diagnostic reasoning, bias awareness, and metacognition are not peripheral features but are embedded in the simulation itself.

A case definition includes four core elements:

1. **Initial Presentation** — chief complaint, basic demographic information, and contextual framing (e.g., "elderly woman with worsening dyspnea").

2. **Information Blocks** — modular clinical facts (history, examination, investigations, medications), progressively revealed through learner queries. Each block is annotated with disclosure metadata.

3. **Bias Triggers** — metadata defining when and how anchoring, confirmation, or framing biases are likely to occur, along with corrective prompts.

4. **Educational Notes** — learning objectives, clinical pearls, and structured reflection questions linked to key diagnostic moments.

Example case structure:

```json
{
  "caseId": "mull_case",
  "caseTitle": "An elderly woman with dyspnea",
  "initialPresentation": {
    "chiefComplaint": "Worsening shortness of breath",
    "historyProvider": "Son (patient is Spanish-speaking)",
    "contextualFrame": "History of 'heart failure'"
  },
  "informationBlocks": [...],
  "biasTriggers": {...},
  "educationalNotes": {...}
}
```

By embedding these components into a single schema, SmartDoc avoids the limitations of scripted, branching cases. Instead, the case itself defines when information is revealed, where bias prompts are activated, and how reflection is scaffolded.

## Information Blocks and Progressive Disclosure

Information is stored in modular **information blocks**, each annotated with structured metadata that governs its revelation:

- **blockId** — unique identifier (e.g., `critical_infliximab`, `imaging_cxr_preliminary`)
- **blockType** — category (e.g., Medications, Imaging, Labs, History)
- **content** — the actual clinical information to be revealed
- **level** — depth of inquiry required (1 = basic, 2 = detailed, 3 = comprehensive)
- **intentTriggers** — array of intent IDs that can reveal this block
- **prerequisites** — blocks that must be revealed first
- **isCritical** — boolean flag for diagnostically essential information
- **revealPolicy** — revelation strategy (`immediate`, `escalate`, `conditional`)

Example information block:

```json
{
  "blockId": "critical_infliximab",
  "blockType": "Medications",
  "content": "Records from previous hospitalizations reveal the patient has been receiving infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis for the past 3-4 months.",
  "isCritical": true,
  "intentTriggers": ["meds_full_reconciliation_query"],
  "level": 2,
  "prerequisites": ["meds_ra_uncertainty"],
  "revealPolicy": "escalate"
}
```

In this example, the infliximab information (critical for diagnosing miliary tuberculosis) is revealed only after learners probe medication history in detail and specifically request previous hospital records. This design resists **premature closure** by requiring persistence and systematic inquiry.

### Progressive Disclosure in Practice

Information revelation follows a structured ladder of inquiry depth:

- **Level 1**: Basic data disclosed with minimal inquiry (e.g., vital signs, chief complaint, known medications)
- **Level 2**: Detailed information requiring specific follow-up questions (e.g., medication reconciliation, imaging studies)
- **Level 3**: Comprehensive data requiring expert-level probing (e.g., detailed medication history from external records)

This mechanism operationalizes:

- **Anchoring bias** — learners who accept surface-level data (e.g., elevated BNP) without deeper investigation risk missing contradictory findings.
- **Premature closure** — learners who fail to escalate inquiries miss critical diagnostic clues.
- **Framing bias** — the initial presentation label influences which information blocks learners pursue.

## Intent-Block Mapping Architecture

Each information block can be revealed through multiple intent pathways, enabling flexible yet pedagogically meaningful interactions. SmartDoc employs two mapping strategies:

### Direct Block Mapping

Used when semantic specificity in questioning should be rewarded. The learner's precise phrasing determines which information is revealed:

- `meds_ra_specific_initial_query` → `meds_ra_uncertainty`
- `meds_full_reconciliation_query` → `critical_infliximab`
- `imaging_echo` → `critical_echo`

This design rewards targeted clinical inquiry over generic questioning.

### Group-Based Escalation

Used when repeated probing of the same domain should progressively reveal more detail:

- First labs inquiry → `labs_general` (CBC, basic chemistry)
- Second labs inquiry → `labs_cardiac` (BNP, troponin)
- Third labs inquiry → `labs_specialized` (additional markers)

### Design Rationale

The choice between direct mapping and group escalation is pedagogically motivated. For medication history, SmartDoc intentionally uses **direct block mapping** rather than pure escalation counting. This rewards semantic precision in questioning ("Can you get her complete medication list from previous hospitalizations?") rather than mere repetition of generic queries.

Example from production data:

1. "Any regular medication?" → reveals basic list (lisinopril, atenolol, glipizide, metformin)
2. "Medications for rheumatoid arthritis?" → reveals uncertainty block ("I'm not sure about her RA medications")
3. "Can you get her complete medication list from previous hospitalizations?" → reveals infliximab

This mapping strategy operationalizes the distinction between surface-level and deep clinical reasoning, directly addressing the pedagogical goals outlined in Chapter 2.

## Educational Scaffolding Within Progressive Disclosure

Beyond simple information gating, SmartDoc implements dynamic educational hints when learners exhibit signs of being stuck. This addresses a key limitation of purely discovery-based learning: learners may become frustrated when unable to progress, but providing direct answers undermines the learning experience.

### Example: Medication Reconciliation Scaffolding

When a learner repeatedly asks about rheumatoid arthritis medications without progressing to full reconciliation:

1. **First query** (`meds_ra_specific_initial_query`):  
   → "I'm not sure about her rheumatoid arthritis medications, I'm sorry."

2. **Second identical query**:  
   → "Like I said, I'm not sure. Maybe you could check her previous hospital records? I know she's had some treatments at other facilities."

This just-in-time guidance models expert clinical reasoning (consulting external records for medication history) without revealing the answer directly. The hint emerges naturally from the virtual patient's dialogue, maintaining immersion while providing pedagogical scaffolding.

This dynamic scaffolding mechanism was developed iteratively through production testing with medical students and addresses findings from Chapter 3 regarding the need for adaptive support in AI-powered learning environments.

## Embedded Bias Triggers

Bias triggers are encoded directly in case metadata, allowing real-time monitoring of learner reasoning patterns. Each trigger specifies:

- The **anchor information** that may mislead learners,
- The **contradictory evidence** that should prompt reconsideration,
- The **bias type** being demonstrated,
- The **intervention prompt** to encourage metacognition.

Example bias trigger (anchoring):

```json
"biasTriggers": {
  "anchoring": {
    "anchorInfoId": "imaging_cxr_preliminary",
    "contradictoryInfoId": "critical_echo",
    "description": "Anchoring on preliminary chest X-ray interpretation ('pulmonary vascular congestion') delays recognition of normal echocardiogram, leading to incorrect heart failure diagnosis.",
    "interventionPrompt": "You seem focused on a cardiac explanation. What else could explain dyspnea with this pattern?"
  }
}
```

### Bias Detection Logic

The system monitors learner behavior patterns and triggers warnings based on configurable thresholds:

```
IF recent_queries.focus_on("cardiac|heart|failure") > 70%
AND contradictory_echo_revealed
AND hypothesis_unchanged
THEN trigger_bias_warning("anchoring")
     prompt_reflection("What else could explain these findings?")
```

This transforms abstract debiasing strategies (e.g., cognitive forcing, described in Chapter 2) into concrete, in-the-moment educational interventions.

## Educational Notes and Reflection Support

Each case embeds learning objectives, clinical pearls, and structured reflection prompts that guide post-diagnosis review:

```json
"educationalNotes": {
  "learningPoints": [
    "Medication reconciliation is crucial in patients with multimorbidity",
    "TNF-alpha inhibitors substantially increase tuberculosis reactivation risk",
    "Normal echocardiogram effectively rules out heart failure as primary etiology"
  ],
  "clinicalPearls": [
    "Miliary pattern on chest CT: innumerable 1-2mm nodules",
    "Always verify medication history from multiple sources"
  ],
  "biasAwareness": [
    "Anchoring on initial 'heart failure' framing delays alternative diagnoses",
    "Confirmation bias: seeking cardiac evidence while ignoring pulmonary clues"
  ]
}
```

At diagnostic closure, learners are presented with structured reflection prompts:

- What evidence supports your diagnosis?
- What evidence contradicts it?
- What alternative explanations remain plausible?
- What was the single most compelling piece of evidence?
- What biases might have influenced your reasoning?

This operationalizes **deliberate reflection** (Chapter 2) and ensures that metacognition is not optional but embedded in the workflow.

## Application: The Mull Case

The prototype case adapts Mull et al.'s published case of diagnostic error, in which an elderly woman with dyspnea was repeatedly misdiagnosed with heart failure due to cognitive biases. SmartDoc encodes this case by:

- **Framing** the initial presentation as "elderly patient with history of heart failure",
- **Embedding anchoring triggers** around chest X-ray interpretation and elevated BNP,
- **Requiring medication reconciliation** to reveal immunosuppressant use,
- **Providing contradictory evidence** through normal echocardiogram,
- **Revealing critical findings** only through persistent, specific questioning.

This case demonstrates how SmartDoc transforms published case reports of diagnostic error into interactive learning experiences that make cognitive bias tangible and addressable.

## Innovation Summary

The intent-driven case design provides several key innovations:

1. **Conversational learning** — natural dialogue replaces scripted question trees, enabling authentic clinical inquiry.
2. **Embedded bias education** — bias triggers built into case metadata enable real-time detection and intervention.
3. **Progressive disclosure** — learners earn critical clues by resisting bias-prone shortcuts and pursuing systematic investigation.
4. **Dynamic scaffolding** — educational hints emerge when learners are stuck, maintaining challenge without causing frustration.
5. **Research-ready design** — interaction logs capture complete reasoning traces for empirical analysis.

In this way, SmartDoc transforms case-based learning from passive fact recall to active, bias-aware clinical reasoning practice, directly addressing gaps identified in both the cognitive psychology literature (Chapter 2) and AI-powered virtual patient research (Chapter 3).
# 4.1.4 Intent Classification System

The Intent Classifier is a foundational component of SmartDoc's architecture, responsible for translating natural language queries into structured clinical intents that drive information disclosure. Unlike template-matching or keyword-based systems, SmartDoc employs a hybrid LLM-powered approach that balances linguistic flexibility with reliability.

## Intent Taxonomy

SmartDoc employs a comprehensive taxonomy of 33 clinical intents organized across three diagnostic phases. This taxonomy was developed through analysis of clinical reasoning literature and iterative refinement during pilot testing.

**Table 4.1: Intent Categories by Diagnostic Phase**

| Phase | Intent Category | Example Intents | Count |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Anamnesis | Past Medical History | `pmh_general`, `pmh_family_history`, `pmh_surgical_history` | 3 |
| Anamnesis | History of Present Illness | `hpi_chief_complaint`, `hpi_onset_duration_primary`, `hpi_fever`, `hpi_chills`, `hpi_chest_pain`, `hpi_weight_changes` | 9 |
| Anamnesis | Medications | `meds_current_known`, `meds_ra_specific_initial_query`, `meds_full_reconciliation_query` | 3 |
| Anamnesis | Social History | `social_smoking`, `social_alcohol`, `social_occupation` | 3 |
| Physical Examination | General Exam | `exam_vital`, `exam_general_appearance` | 2 |
| Physical Examination | System-Specific | `exam_cardiovascular`, `exam_respiratory` | 2 |
| Investigations | Laboratory | `labs_general`, `labs_specific_cbc`, `labs_specific_bnp` | 5 |
| Investigations | Imaging | `imaging_chest_xray`, `imaging_ct_chest`, `imaging_echo` | 6 |

Each intent is defined with:

- **Intent ID** — unique identifier used for mapping to information blocks
- **Description** — semantic definition of what the intent represents
- **Examples** — sample queries that should trigger this intent
- **Negative examples** — queries that should NOT trigger this intent
- **Context availability** — which diagnostic phases permit this intent

This structured taxonomy enables both accurate classification and systematic case design.

## Classification Pipeline

The intent classification process follows a multi-stage pipeline designed to maximize accuracy while maintaining responsiveness:

### Stage 1: Context Filtering

Before classification begins, the system determines which intents are currently available based on the diagnostic phase:

- **Anamnesis phase** → only history, medication, and social intents available
- **Examination phase** → only physical examination intents available
- **Investigations phase** → only laboratory and imaging intents available

This context-aware filtering reduces ambiguity and improves accuracy by constraining the classification space. For example, the query "vital signs" during anamnesis would be rejected, prompting the learner to transition to the examination phase.

### Stage 2: LLM-Based Classification

The filtered set of intents is passed to an LLM with a structured prompt that includes:

- The learner's query
- The current diagnostic context
- Definitions and examples for each available intent
- Instructions to return the most appropriate intent with confidence score

Example prompt structure:

```
You are a clinical reasoning assistant. Classify the following doctor's query into one of the available intents.

Context: anamnesis
Query: "What brings you here today?"

Available intents:
- pmh_general: Questions about past medical history, diseases, conditions, diagnoses. Does NOT include medications.
  Examples: "What is her medical history?", "Any chronic conditions?"
  
- hpi_chief_complaint: Questions about the main presenting complaint or reason for visit.
  Examples: "What brings you here?", "Why did you come to the clinic?"

Return: intent_id, confidence (0-1), explanation
```

The LLM returns structured output:

```json
{
  "intent_id": "hpi_chief_complaint",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "explanation": "The doctor is asking what brings the patient to the clinic, which directly addresses the chief complaint within the anamnesis phase."
}
```

### Stage 3: Confidence Thresholding

Classification results are evaluated against a confidence threshold (default: 0.3):

- **High confidence (≥ 0.7)** — intent accepted, information disclosure proceeds
- **Medium confidence (0.3-0.7)** — intent accepted with caution, logged for review
- **Low confidence (< 0.3)** — classification rejected, system requests clarification

This threshold was calibrated through pilot testing to balance false positives (incorrect intent) against false negatives (missing valid queries).

### Stage 4: Keyword Fallback

If LLM classification fails (timeout, parsing error, low confidence) or returns unexpected results, the system employs keyword-based fallback matching:

```python
fallback_mappings = {
    "vital signs|vitals|temperature|blood pressure|heart rate": "exam_vital",
    "past medical history|medical history|chronic conditions": "pmh_general",
    "chest x-ray|chest xray|cxr": "imaging_chest_xray",
    "complete blood count|CBC|hemoglobin": "labs_specific_cbc",
    ...
}
```

This hybrid approach ensures reliability even when LLM inference is unavailable or produces invalid output.

## Intent Specificity and Semantic Precision

A key design principle of SmartDoc's intent taxonomy is rewarding **semantic precision** in clinical questioning. This is particularly evident in the medication intent hierarchy:

- `meds_current_known` — generic query about current medications  
  → "Any regular medication?", "What does she take?"
  
- `meds_ra_specific_initial_query` — specific query about rheumatoid arthritis treatment  
  → "Medications for rheumatoid arthritis?", "Any biologics?"
  
- `meds_full_reconciliation_query` — expert-level query for comprehensive medication review  
  → "Can you get her complete medication list from previous hospitalizations?"

Each intent maps to progressively more detailed information blocks, operationalizing the concept that expert clinicians ask more targeted questions. This design resists the common educational pitfall of rewarding generic, unfocused inquiry.

## Production Refinements and Accuracy Improvements

The intent classification system underwent iterative refinement through production testing with medical students. Two significant issues were identified and resolved:

### Issue 1: PMH vs. Medications Confusion

**Initial observation**: The query "What is her past medical history?" was frequently misclassified as `meds_current_known` (confidence 0.95), despite medications being explicitly excluded from the PMH intent definition.

**Root cause**: Insufficient negative examples in intent descriptions, leading the LLM to conflate "medical history" with "everything about the patient."

**Solution**: Enhanced both intents with explicit examples and negative constraints:

```python
pmh_general: {
  "description": "Questions about past medical history, diseases, conditions, and diagnoses. Does NOT include medications.",
  "examples": [
    "What is her medical history?",
    "What is her past medical history?",
    "Any chronic conditions?",
    "What problems does she have?"
  ],
  "negative_examples": [
    "What medications does she take?" (→ meds_current_known)
  ]
}

meds_current_known: {
  "description": "Questions about current medications. Must explicitly mention 'medication', 'drug', 'pill', 'prescription' or similar terms. NOT for medical history or diagnoses.",
  "examples": [
    "Any regular medication?",
    "What drugs does she take?",
    "Is she on any prescriptions?"
  ],
  "negative_examples": [
    "What is her medical history?" (→ pmh_general)
  ]
}
```

**Result**: Classification accuracy for PMH queries improved from 57% to >95% in production testing.

### Issue 2: Context-Inappropriate Intent Acceptance

**Initial observation**: During physical examination, queries like "Any medications?" were being accepted and classified, causing confusion about diagnostic phase progression.

**Solution**: Implemented strict context filtering that rejects intents not available in the current phase, with explicit feedback:

> "That question is more appropriate for the history-taking phase. You are currently in the physical examination phase."

**Result**: Eliminated cross-phase classification errors and improved learner awareness of diagnostic workflow structure.

**Table 4.2: Intent Classification Accuracy Improvements**

| Configuration | PMH vs. Meds Accuracy | Cross-Phase Errors | Overall Accuracy |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Baseline (generic descriptions) | 57% | 23% | 78% |
| Enhanced descriptions | 95% | 18% | 87% |
| + Context filtering | 95% | 0% | 96% |

These improvements demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement based on actual learner interactions, a key finding that will inform the discussion of educational design in Chapter 5.

## Handling Ambiguity and Uncertainty

The classification system is designed to acknowledge and handle ambiguous queries rather than forcing inappropriate classifications:

### Clarification Requests

When confidence falls below threshold or multiple intents appear equally valid, the system requests clarification:

> "I'm not sure I understood your question. Are you asking about [interpretation A] or [interpretation B]?"

This models good clinical communication practice and prevents incorrect information disclosure.

### Intent Logging and Analysis

All classification decisions are logged with full context:

```json
{
  "query": "What is her past medical history?",
  "context": "anamnesis",
  "classified_intent": "pmh_general",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "explanation": "...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T22:47:52Z"
}
```

These logs enable:

1. **Quality assurance** — manual review of classification decisions
2. **System improvement** — identification of recurring misclassifications
3. **Educational research** — analysis of learner questioning patterns

This comprehensive logging addresses the call in Chapter 3 for more transparent and auditable AI-powered educational systems.

## Integration with Case Design

The intent taxonomy is tightly coupled with case design through the intent-block mapping system described in Section 4.1.3. Each information block specifies which intents can reveal it, creating a bidirectional relationship:

- **Case designers** specify which clinical questions should reveal each piece of information
- **The intent classifier** determines which clinical question the learner is asking
- **The discovery processor** matches classified intents to available blocks

This architecture enables case-specific pedagogical control while maintaining conversational flexibility, a key innovation of the SmartDoc platform.
# 4.2 Part II: Technical Implementation

This section presents the technical implementation of SmartDoc. While Part I focused on the architectural principles and modular design, this section details how the components were executed in practice, including runtime configuration, large language model integration, database architecture, deployment configuration, and production refinements.

## 4.2.1 Overview and Execution Pipeline

The SmartDoc pipeline follows a sequence of phases that mirror the cognitive processes of a clinical encounter. Each phase is encapsulated in a dedicated module, enabling independent testing and future extension.

### System Startup and Configuration

Upon initialization, the system loads:

- **Case definitions** from structured JSON files (symptoms, information blocks, bias triggers)
- **Intent taxonomy** with descriptions, examples, and context availability rules
- **LLM provider configuration** (model selection, temperature settings, timeout thresholds)
- **Database connection** for persistent storage of sessions and reasoning traces

### Request Processing Flow

When a learner submits a query (e.g., "What are the patient's vital signs?"), the system processes it through six sequential phases:

**1. Query Initiation and Routing**

The system captures both the input text and its context (session ID, current diagnostic phase, previously revealed information). The request is passed to the Intent-Driven Disclosure Manager, the central orchestrator.

**2. Intent Classification**

The system determines what the learner is trying to accomplish. This operationalizes **System 1 pattern recognition** (rapid, intuitive categorization) while maintaining hooks for **System 2 monitoring** (deliberate oversight of the reasoning process).

The classification pipeline:
- Filters intents by current diagnostic phase (context awareness)
- Submits query + available intents to LLM with structured prompt
- Receives classification with confidence score and explanation
- Falls back to keyword matching if LLM classification fails

Low-confidence classifications trigger clarification requests rather than potentially incorrect information disclosure.

**3. Discovery Processing**

Once the intent is identified, the Discovery Processor determines what information to reveal:

```
identified_intent = "exam_cardiovascular"
↓
mapped_blocks = get_blocks_triggered_by(intent)
↓
eligible_blocks = filter_by_prerequisites(mapped_blocks, revealed_history)
↓
reveal(eligible_blocks)
```

This implements **progressive disclosure**, ensuring students must actively seek evidence rather than receive it passively. Prerequisites enforce logical clinical sequencing (e.g., cannot order CT scan before obtaining history).

**4. Response Generation**

Contextually appropriate responses are generated based on the diagnostic phase:

- **Anamnesis phase**: `AnamnesisSonResponder` generates family member dialogue, modeling uncertainty ("I think...", "I'm not sure...") and using simplified medical terminology.

- **Physical examination**: `ExamObjectiveResponder` provides descriptive clinical findings using standardized medical language.

- **Investigations**: `LabsResidentResponder` delivers laboratory or imaging results in professional format, with direct responses for unavailable tests.

When no information exists for a classified intent (WITH_DATA = false), responders generate appropriate fallback responses that maintain immersion without revealing that the information doesn't exist in the case.

**5. Bias Detection and Session Logging**

In parallel with response generation, the Bias Analyzer monitors interaction patterns:

```python
if focus_on_single_hypothesis > 70%:
    trigger_bias_warning("anchoring")
    prompt = "You seem focused on a single diagnosis. What else could explain these findings?"
    log_bias_event(type="anchoring", timestamp=now(), prompt=prompt)
```

Detected events are logged with full context, creating a traceable record for both real-time intervention and post-session analysis.

**6. Assembly and Delivery**

The system compiles:
- The virtual patient's response (dialogue or results)
- Newly revealed information (clinical facts added to student's knowledge)
- Any bias warnings or metacognitive prompts
- Progress indicators (% of case completed, critical findings status)

This complete package is returned to the learner's interface and persisted to the database.

### Handling of Uncertainty and Edge Cases

The pipeline includes multiple safeguards for unexpected situations:

**Ambiguous Queries**: When intent classification confidence falls below threshold (0.3), the system requests clarification rather than making potentially incorrect assumptions.

**Unavailable Information**: When a classified intent has no corresponding information blocks, responders generate contextually appropriate responses (e.g., "That test hasn't been performed at this time").

**LLM Failures**: When LLM inference fails (timeout, parsing error), the system falls back to keyword-based intent matching and deterministic response templates, ensuring educational functionality is maintained.

**Session Interruptions**: All state changes are immediately persisted to the database, allowing sessions to be resumed even after abrupt termination.

This modular execution pipeline ensures controlled information flow (supporting debiasing strategies), authentic immersion, and reproducibility—directly addressing pedagogical requirements and gaps identified in Chapter 3.

## Algorithm 1: Intent-Driven Progressive Disclosure

The core algorithm that orchestrates information revelation:

```
Input: user_query, session_context, revealed_blocks
Output: information_blocks, educational_hints, bias_warnings

1:  diagnostic_phase ← session_context.current_phase
2:  available_intents ← filter_intents_by_phase(diagnostic_phase)
3:  
4:  classification ← LLM_classify(user_query, available_intents)
5:  if classification.confidence < 0.3 then
6:      return request_clarification(query, available_intents)
7:  end if
8:  
9:  intent ← classification.intent_id
10: mapped_blocks ← get_intent_block_mappings(intent, case)
11: eligible_blocks ← filter_by_prerequisites(mapped_blocks, revealed_blocks)
12: 
13: // Educational scaffolding logic
14: if intent == "meds_ra_specific_initial_query" then
15:     query_count ← count_previous_queries(intent, session)
16:     if query_count > 1 AND "critical_infliximab" NOT revealed then
17:         hint ← "Maybe you could check her previous hospital records?"
18:         return (eligible_blocks, hint, None)
19:     end if
20: end if
21: 
22: // Bias detection logic  
23: hypothesis_focus ← calculate_focus(revealed_blocks, working_diagnosis)
24: if hypothesis_focus > 0.70 then
25:     contradictory ← detect_contradictions(revealed_blocks, working_diagnosis)
26:     if contradictory exists then
27:         warning ← create_bias_warning("anchoring")
28:         prompt ← "What else could explain these findings?"
29:         return (eligible_blocks, None, (warning, prompt))
30:     end if
31: end if
32: 
33: return (eligible_blocks, None, None)
```

This algorithm integrates intent classification, progressive disclosure, educational scaffolding, and bias detection into a unified decision process that executes on every learner query.

## Algorithm 2: Bias Detection and Warning System

The bias monitoring algorithm that runs continuously during diagnostic sessions:

```
Input: session_history, current_hypothesis, revealed_information
Output: bias_warning or None

1:  recent_queries ← get_last_n_queries(session_history, n=5)
2:  hypothesis_mentions ← count_hypothesis_keywords(recent_queries, current_hypothesis)
3:  total_mentions ← count_total_keywords(recent_queries)
4:  focus_ratio ← hypothesis_mentions / total_mentions
5:  
6:  // Anchoring bias detection
7:  if focus_ratio > 0.70 then
8:      contradictory_info ← detect_contradictions(revealed_information, current_hypothesis)
9:      if contradictory_info is not empty then
10:         log_bias_event(type="anchoring", evidence=contradictory_info)
11:         prompt ← "You seem focused on " + current_hypothesis + ". What else could explain these findings?"
12:         return BiasWarning(type="anchoring", prompt=prompt, severity="moderate")
13:     end if
14: end if
15: 
16: // Confirmation bias detection
17: supporting_queries ← count_queries_seeking_confirmation(recent_queries, current_hypothesis)
18: refuting_queries ← count_queries_seeking_refutation(recent_queries, current_hypothesis)
19: if supporting_queries > 0 AND refuting_queries == 0 then
20:     if length(recent_queries) >= 4 then
21:         log_bias_event(type="confirmation", pattern="seeking only supporting evidence")
22:         prompt ← "Consider evidence that might contradict your working diagnosis"
23:         return BiasWarning(type="confirmation", prompt=prompt, severity="low")
24:     end if
25: end if
26: 
27: // Premature closure detection
28: critical_blocks ← get_critical_blocks(case)
29: revealed_critical ← filter_revealed(critical_blocks, revealed_information)
30: if length(revealed_critical) < 0.6 * length(critical_blocks) then
31:     if diagnosis_submitted then
32:         log_bias_event(type="premature_closure", coverage=length(revealed_critical))
33:         // Note: warning after diagnosis, used in evaluation
34:         return BiasWarning(type="premature_closure", prompt=None, severity="high")
35:     end if
36: end if
37: 
38: return None
```

This algorithm operationalizes the bias taxonomy from Chapter 2 into computational detection rules, enabling real-time identification of bias-prone reasoning patterns.
# 4.2.2 Technology Stack and LLM Integration

Given the critical role of language models in SmartDoc and the variability inherent in LLM behavior, the system employs a carefully designed abstraction architecture to remain model-agnostic while ensuring reproducibility and educational reliability.

## Core Technology Stack

SmartDoc was implemented on a lightweight and modular technology stack focused on reproducibility, portability, and ease of deployment for educational settings.

**Table 4.3: Core Technologies and Versions**

| Component | Technology | Version | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Backend Framework | Flask | 3.0+ | Lightweight, flexible routing, excellent for educational prototypes |
| Language | Python | 3.13+ | Ecosystem maturity, AI/ML library support |
| Dependency Management | Poetry | 1.8+ | Reproducible environments, lockfile-based versioning |
| ORM & Database | SQLAlchemy + Alembic | 2.0+ | Database-agnostic, migration support, research portability |
| Data Validation | Pydantic | 2.0+ | Type-safe schemas, automatic validation, JSON serialization |
| LLM Interface | Ollama | Latest | Local model hosting, no external API dependencies |
| LLM Model | Gemma 3:4b-it-q4_K_M | 4B parameters | Balance of quality, speed, and resource requirements |
| Frontend | HTML/CSS/JavaScript | ES2020+ | No build step, static serving, maximum compatibility |
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose | 24.0+ | Reproducible deployments, environment isolation |
| Production Server | Gunicorn | 21.0+ | WSGI serving, concurrent request handling |

## LLM Provider Abstraction

All language model interactions are mediated through a standardized `LLMProvider` interface with a single `generate()` function. This design:

- **Decouples pedagogical logic** from vendor-specific implementations, allowing the educational architecture to evolve independently of model choices.
- **Enables diverse deployment contexts**: local models for research reproducibility and data privacy, cloud-based models for production scale.
- **Supports model substitution** as the field evolves, a key concern raised in Chapter 3 regarding sustainability of AI-powered educational systems.

Example provider interface:

```python
class LLMProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate(
        self,
        prompt: str,
        temperature: float = 0.7,
        max_tokens: int = 500,
        response_format: Optional[Dict] = None
    ) -> str:
        """Generate text from prompt with specified parameters."""
        pass
```

Concrete implementations exist for:
- **OllamaProvider** — local model hosting via Ollama
- **OpenAIProvider** — cloud API for GPT models
- **AnthropicProvider** — cloud API for Claude models
- **MockProvider** — deterministic responses for testing

## Model Selection and Benchmarking

Several open-source models were evaluated to determine the optimal balance of generation quality, inference speed, structured output reliability, and resource requirements:

**Candidates evaluated:**
- `llama3.1:8b`, `llama3.2:latest`
- `gemma3:4b-it-q4_K_M`, `gemma2:9b`
- `qwen2.5:7b`, `qwen2.5:14b`
- `deepseek-r1:7b`

Evaluation criteria:
1. **Structured output consistency** — ability to reliably produce valid JSON
2. **Clinical reasoning quality** — appropriateness of diagnostic inferences
3. **Inference latency** — response time for typical prompts
4. **Portuguese language support** — though SmartDoc is English-focused, multilingual capability was considered for future localization

The model `gemma3:4b-it-q4_K_M` was ultimately selected for all core reasoning tasks including intent classification, response generation, bias analysis, and clinical evaluation. It demonstrated the best tradeoff between generation quality (clear, clinically appropriate language), runtime performance (<2s for typical inferences), and structured output reliability (>95% valid JSON on first attempt).

The 4-bit quantization (`q4_K_M`) reduces memory requirements to ~3GB while maintaining acceptable output quality, enabling deployment on consumer-grade hardware without dedicated GPU infrastructure.

## Temperature Configuration by Module

Different modules require different levels of determinism versus creativity. SmartDoc employs module-specific temperature settings to optimize each component's behavior:

**Table 4.4: LLM Temperature Settings by Module**

| Module | Temperature | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Intent Classification | 0.3 | Consistency and reliability; same query should yield same intent |
| Clinical Evaluation | 0.3 | Reproducible scoring; similar performance should receive similar grades |
| Bias Analysis | 0.3 | Reliable pattern detection; consistent identification of reasoning errors |
| AnamnesisSonResponder | 0.5 | Natural family dialogue with some variability, but maintains consistency |
| LabsResidentResponder | 0.3 | Professional, deterministic medical reporting |
| ExamObjectiveResponder | 0.3 | Standardized clinical examination findings |
| Node Summarization | 0.4 | Stylistic variation while preserving clinical accuracy |

This fine-grained control addresses a key finding from Chapter 3: AI-powered educational systems must balance naturalness with reproducibility. Lower temperatures ensure fairness in assessment and consistent pedagogical behavior, while moderate temperatures in dialogue generation maintain engagement without compromising educational goals.

## Structured Output Parsing and Validation

SmartDoc requires structured outputs (JSON) from most LLM operations to enable programmatic processing. However, open-source models hosted locally do not support strict schema enforcement (unlike commercial APIs with function calling). Consequently, a dedicated post-processing and validation pipeline was implemented:

### Parsing Pipeline

**1. Direct JSON Parsing Attempt**

The raw model output is first parsed directly as JSON. If successful, no further processing is required.

**2. Regex Pre-Extraction**

If parsing fails, regular expressions extract the most probable JSON block from the text, compensating for common model behaviors such as:
- Extraneous explanations before or after the JSON
- Incomplete bracket closure
- Embedded code fence markers (```json ... ```)

Example extraction pattern:
```python
json_pattern = r'\{[^{}]*(?:\{[^{}]*\}[^{}]*)*\}'
matches = re.findall(json_pattern, raw_output, re.DOTALL)
```

**3. Pydantic Schema Validation**

Extracted data is validated against task-specific Pydantic schemas:

```python
class IntentClassification(BaseModel):
    intent_id: str
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    explanation: str

# Validation
try:
    result = IntentClassification.model_validate_json(json_text)
except ValidationError as e:
    # Proceed to retry mechanism
```

**4. Retry Mechanism**

If any preceding step fails, the system automatically re-queries the model with identical inputs. This can occur up to 4 times before triggering fallback mechanisms. Retries often succeed because of the stochastic nature of LLM generation.

**5. Fallback Mechanisms**

When all parsing and recovery attempts fail, the system implements conservative fallbacks to maintain session stability and clinical safety:

- **Intent classification** — falls back to keyword matching against a curated dictionary
- **Response generation** — uses deterministic templates based on information block content
- **Bias analysis** — relies on rule-based heuristics only
- **Clinical evaluation** — returns placeholder scores with "unable to evaluate" justification

These fallbacks ensure that LLM unreliability does not compromise the educational experience, a critical design principle for high-stakes learning environments.

## Dependency Injection for Testing and Flexibility

Rather than hardcoding model usage, LLM providers are injected into each component through constructor parameters:

```python
class IntentClassifier:
    def __init__(self, provider: LLMProvider, temperature: float = 0.3):
        self.provider = provider
        self.temperature = temperature
    
    def classify(self, query: str, available_intents: List[Intent]) -> Classification:
        prompt = self._build_prompt(query, available_intents)
        response = self.provider.generate(prompt, temperature=self.temperature)
        return self._parse_response(response)
```

This enables:

- **Isolated unit testing** with mock providers that return predetermined responses
- **Configuration flexibility** tailored to educational scenarios (fast models for classification, more capable models for complex reasoning)
- **Consistent software engineering practices** that ensure reliability and maintainability

## Prompt Engineering and Modularity

All prompts are modular and externally configurable, stored as template strings with variable substitution. This allows experimentation without modifying code:

```python
INTENT_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are a clinical reasoning assistant. Classify the doctor's query into the most appropriate clinical intent.

Context: {diagnostic_phase}
Query: "{user_query}"

Available intents:
{intent_definitions}

Return JSON: {"intent_id": "...", "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "explanation": "..."}
"""
```

Each prompt defines:
- **Role** — the perspective the LLM should adopt (e.g., "clinical reasoning assistant")
- **Context** — current state (diagnostic phase, revealed information, hypothesis status)
- **Task** — specific objective (classify intent, generate response, detect bias)
- **Output format** — required structure (JSON schema, specific fields)
- **Constraints** — behavioral rules (clinical appropriateness, language level)

This structure supports A/B testing of pedagogical strategies (e.g., different ways of framing reflection questions), linking directly to the literature's call for rigorous evaluation of design choices.

## Robustness and Validation

Robustness is ensured through comprehensive testing that simulates diverse model behaviors:

- **Normal responses** — typical, well-formatted outputs
- **Malformed JSON** — incomplete brackets, extra text, formatting errors
- **Timeouts** — slow inference or unavailable services
- **Unexpected content** — outputs that don't match expected schemas
- **Empty responses** — model returns nothing

Each failure mode triggers specific recovery strategies, ensuring graceful degradation rather than system failure. This directly addresses concerns in Chapter 3 regarding reproducibility and reliability of AI-powered virtual patient systems.

The combination of provider abstraction, temperature control, structured validation, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive fallbacks creates a robust LLM integration architecture that balances educational quality with technical reliability.
# 4.2.3 Response Generation and Production Refinements

SmartDoc employs a sophisticated multi-responder architecture that generates contextually appropriate dialogue based on the current diagnostic phase. This section describes the response generation pipeline and the significant refinements that emerged from production testing with medical students.

## Responder Architecture

Three specialized responder modules handle different types of clinical interactions:

### AnamnesisSonResponder

Simulates dialogue with a family member (the patient's son) during history-taking. This responder must balance realism with pedagogical objectives:

**Key characteristics:**
- **Uncertainty modeling** — uses phrases like "I think...", "I'm not sure...", "as far as I know" to simulate realistic recall limitations
- **Simplified medical terminology** — avoids technical language that a layperson wouldn't use
- **Educational hints** — when learners appear stuck, provides gentle guidance toward productive inquiry paths
- **Conversational naturalness** — varies phrasing to avoid repetitive, robotic responses

**Response generation process:**

1. **WITH_DATA scenario** — when information exists for the classified intent:
   ```python
   # Direct response from information block
   content = block.content  # e.g., "She has diabetes, hypertension..."
   response = self._add_conversational_markers(content)
   # Result: "Uh, she has diabetes, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis."
   ```

2. **WITHOUT_DATA scenario** — when no information exists for the query:
   ```python
   # LLM-generated fallback response
   prompt = self._build_fallback_prompt(query, context, revealed_info)
   response = llm.generate(prompt, temperature=0.5)
   # Result: Natural, contextually appropriate response explaining unavailability
   ```

### LabsResidentResponder

Delivers investigation results (laboratory tests, imaging studies) in professional medical language:

**Key characteristics:**
- **Direct, professional tone** — clinical precision without unnecessary verbosity
- **Standardized formatting** — consistent presentation of numerical results with units
- **Immediate availability** — no artificial delays or elaborate explanations
- **Appropriate unavailability responses** — clear, concise statements when tests haven't been performed

**Response strategy:**

**WITH_DATA:**
```python
# Example: BNP results
"The cardiac lab results show a pro-BNP level greater than the upper limit of normal."
```

**WITHOUT_DATA (refined approach):**
```python
# Simple, direct response
"That test hasn't been performed at this time."
```

This simplicity emerged from production testing, where verbose explanations confused learners (see Section 4.2.3.2).

### ExamObjectiveResponder

Provides physical examination findings with clinical precision:

**Key characteristics:**
- **Objective findings only** — no subjective interpretations
- **Standardized medical terminology** — uses appropriate clinical language
- **Systematic reporting** — organized by body system
- **Pertinent negatives** — explicitly states absence of findings when clinically relevant

**Example responses:**
```
"Vital signs: Temperature 99.9°F (37.7°C), HR 105, BP 140/70, RR 24, O2 sat 89% on room air."

"Heart sounds are normal and there is no lower-extremity edema."

"Pulmonary examination demonstrates crackles in all lung fields."
```

## Production Refinements Based on Learner Interactions

The response generation system underwent three significant refinements through iterative production testing with medical students. These improvements demonstrate the importance of empirical validation in educational AI systems.

### Refinement 1: Labs Response Simplification

**Initial implementation:** When learners requested unavailable tests, the LabsResidentResponder generated verbose clarification-seeking responses:

> "I'm not sure I understand that question. Could you clarify what specific test you're asking about?"

**Problem identified:** This verbosity was pedagogically counterproductive:
- Broke immersion by treating unavailable information as confusion
- Created unnecessary back-and-forth dialogue
- Made learners question whether they had used incorrect medical terminology
- Wasted time on clarification rather than advancing diagnostic reasoning

**Solution implemented:** Direct, professional unavailability response:

> "That test hasn't been performed at this time."

**Result:** Learners understood immediately that the test simply wasn't available and moved on to alternative inquiry strategies. Session logs showed a 40% reduction in clarification exchanges and improved diagnostic efficiency.

### Refinement 2: Simplified Fallback Prompts

**Initial implementation:** When the son (AnamnesisSonResponder) needed to generate WITHOUT_DATA responses, the system used a verbose prompt with extensive prohibition examples:

```
ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
❌ Do NOT mention: surgeries, procedures, hospitalizations
❌ Do NOT discuss: detailed medications, specific dosages
❌ Do NOT reference: medical records, doctor's notes

WHAT TO SAY INSTEAD:
✅ Express uncertainty: "I'm not sure about that"
✅ Suggest alternatives: "You could ask her doctor"
✅ Redirect: "I don't have that information"
```

**Problem identified:** The LLM pattern-matched the prohibition examples, causing bizarre responses:

Student: "Does she take any medications?"  
Son: "I'm not sure about surgeries or procedures she's had."

The LLM was inadvertently using the prohibited topics as suggestions for what to discuss, despite the ❌ markers.

**Solution implemented:** Drastically simplified prompt with 5 positive rules:

```
CRITICAL RULES:
1. Answer naturally as a family member
2. If uncertain, say "I'm not sure"
3. Stay focused on the question asked
4. Use simple, conversational language
5. Don't invent information
```

**Result:** Natural, contextually appropriate responses without random topic mentions. The confusion rate (learner reports of "strange responses") dropped from 18% to <2% of sessions.

### Refinement 3: Educational Hint Mechanism

**Initial implementation:** No special handling when learners repeatedly asked the same question without progressing.

**Problem identified:** Learners frequently got stuck on the RA medication question:

1. "What medications for rheumatoid arthritis?" → "I'm not sure"
2. "Is she on biologics?" → "I'm not sure"
3. "Any immunosuppressants?" → "I'm not sure"
4. [Learner gives up, misses critical infliximab clue]

**Solution implemented:** Dynamic hint injection after second similar query:

```python
if intent == "meds_ra_specific_initial_query":
    query_count = count_previous_queries(intent, session)
    if query_count > 1 AND "critical_infliximab" NOT revealed:
        response = "Like I said, I'm not sure. Maybe you could check her previous hospital records? I know she's had some treatments at other facilities."
```

**Result:** 85% of learners successfully escalated to `meds_full_reconciliation_query` after receiving the hint, revealing the infliximab information. This demonstrates effective educational scaffolding without revealing answers directly.

## Performance Impact of Refinements

**Table 4.5: Response Quality Improvements Through Production Testing**

| Metric | Initial Version | After Refinements | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Clarification exchanges (avg per session) | 6.2 | 3.7 | 40% reduction |
| "Strange response" reports | 18% of sessions | <2% of sessions | 89% reduction |
| Successful RA medication escalation | 42% | 85% | +43 percentage points |
| Average session duration | 18.3 min | 14.7 min | 20% more efficient |
| Student satisfaction (post-session survey) | 3.2/5.0 | 4.3/5.0 | +1.1 points |

These improvements emerged from analyzing actual learner interactions rather than theoretical design, emphasizing the necessity of iterative refinement in AI-powered educational systems.

## Fallback Response Generation

When generating WITHOUT_DATA responses, the system follows a structured approach:

**Step 1: Context Assembly**
```python
context = {
    "query": student_query,
    "diagnostic_phase": current_phase,
    "revealed_blocks": [block.label for block in revealed],
    "responder_role": "patient's son" or "resident" or "objective exam"
}
```

**Step 2: Prompt Construction**

```python
prompt = f"""
You are the {role}. A medical student asked: "{query}"

Current context:
- Phase: {phase}
- Already discussed: {revealed_topics}

Rules:
1. Answer naturally from your role's perspective
2. If uncertain, say so simply
3. Don't invent information
4. Stay focused on the question

Response:
"""
```

**Step 3: LLM Generation with Fallback**

```python
try:
    response = llm.generate(prompt, temperature=0.5, max_tokens=150)
    response = filter_inappropriate_content(response)
except LLMError:
    # Deterministic fallback
    response = "I'm not sure about that, I'm sorry."
```

**Step 4: Post-Processing**

- Remove extraneous explanations
- Add conversational markers appropriate to role
- Ensure response length is reasonable (<50 words)
- Verify no prohibited information leaked

This multi-stage approach ensures consistent, appropriate responses even when information doesn't exist in the case, maintaining immersion while preventing hallucinations.

## Integration with Educational Scaffolding

The response generation system is tightly integrated with the educational scaffolding mechanisms described in Section 4.1.3. When the Simulation Engine detects specific patterns (e.g., repeated identical queries), it can inject hints directly into the response generation process:

```python
def generate_response(self, block, query, session_context):
    response = self._base_response(block)
    
    # Check for scaffolding opportunities
    if self._should_provide_hint(query, session_context):
        hint = self._generate_educational_hint(session_context)
        response = f"{response} {hint}"
    
    return response
```

This architecture operationalizes the principle of just-in-time educational support: guidance appears precisely when learners need it, without disrupting those who are progressing successfully.

The production refinements documented in this section demonstrate a key finding: AI-powered educational systems require empirical validation with actual learners, not just theoretical design. The three improvements—labs simplification, prompt clarification, and educational hints—only emerged through careful analysis of real student interactions, emphasizing the iterative nature of effective educational technology development.
# 4.2.4 Database Architecture and State Management

To support both responsive simulation and robust research analytics, SmartDoc adopts a dual-layer state management architecture:

1. **In-memory session state** — ensures real-time responsiveness during the learner's interaction with the virtual patient
2. **Persistent database storage** — captures full reasoning traces, bias events, and reflection data for subsequent analysis

This separation allows the system to deliver immediate educational feedback while also creating durable records for evaluation and research.

## Conceptual Schema

The underlying schema is organized around educational workflows rather than technical implementation details. Key entities represent the pedagogical concepts central to diagnostic reasoning education:

**Core Entities:**

- **Users** — learners and administrators with role-based access control
- **Conversations** — the main unit of analysis, representing complete diagnostic sessions
- **Messages** — full history of learner queries and system responses with classified intents
- **SimulationSessions** — metadata about the diagnostic case, status, and performance statistics
- **DiscoveryEvents** — when and how clinical information was revealed, operationalizing progressive disclosure
- **BiasWarnings** — logged instances of anchoring, confirmation, or premature closure detection
- **DiagnosisSubmissions** — final diagnostic hypotheses with reasoning and evaluation scores
- **ReflectionResponses** — learner answers to structured metacognitive prompts
- **AuditLogs** — comprehensive system event logging for reproducibility and security

                  └──► ReflectionResponses (1:N)
                       ├─ question, answer
                       └─ created_at
```

This design ensures that each learner session produces a rich, analyzable dataset that links behavior (intents, queries, revealed information) with outcomes (diagnosis accuracy, bias awareness, metacognitive reflection quality).

## State Management Architecture

During an active simulation, the **Progressive Disclosure Store** maintains session-level state in memory:

```python
class SessionState:
    session_id: str
    case_id: str
    current_phase: DiagnosticPhase  # anamnesis, exam, labs
    revealed_blocks: Set[str]        # IDs of disclosed information
    query_history: List[Query]       # All student queries
    working_hypothesis: Optional[str]  # Current diagnostic focus
    bias_warnings_triggered: List[BiasWarning]
    start_time: datetime
```

This in-memory state enables rapid decision-making during interactions (milliseconds, not database query latency). However, key pedagogical events trigger immediate database writes through event hooks:

```python
@on_reveal
def handle_information_revealed(block: InformationBlock):
    update_session_state(block)
    log_to_database(
        event="discovery",
        category=block.category,
        label=block.label,
        value=block.content,
        block_id=block.id,
        timestamp=now()
    )

@on_bias_detected
def handle_bias_detected(bias_type: str, description: str):
    issue_warning(bias_type)
    log_to_database(
        event="bias_warning",
        bias_type=bias_type,
        description=description,
        timestamp=now()
    )
```

This event-driven design ensures that cognitive bias detection (Chapter 2) and reflection prompts are not only experienced by the learner but also captured for empirical study (addressing gaps identified in Chapter 3).

## Choice of Database Technology

For research purposes, **portability and reproducibility** were prioritized over scalability. SQLite was selected because it:

- **Allows easy sharing** of complete simulation datasets for replication studies (single-file database)
- **Eliminates external dependencies** for participants in multi-site trials
- **Guarantees data integrity** even during abrupt session terminations (ACID compliance)
- **Simplifies deployment** — no separate database server required
- **Ensures reproducibility** — exact database state can be versioned and shared

Although SQLite does not support massive concurrency, SmartDoc's use case involves individual or small-cohort learning sessions, making this a pragmatic and effective choice. The abstraction layer (SQLAlchemy) ensures that the system can migrate to enterprise-grade databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) if future large-scale deployments require it.

## Logging and Reproducibility

SmartDoc implements structured logging for both technical and pedagogical events. For each session, the following are captured:

**Interaction Traces:**
- Learner queries with exact timestamps
- Classified intents with confidence scores and explanations
- Information blocks revealed with revelation sequences
- Response content from each responder module

**Pedagogical Events:**
- Discovery events organized by category (presenting_symptoms, physical_examination, diagnostic_results, current_medications, imaging)
- Bias warnings with type, timing, and contextual triggers
- Reflection prompt presentations and student responses
- Diagnosis submissions with complete evaluation breakdowns

**Technical Metrics:**
- LLM inference times and token counts
- Classification confidence distributions
- Fallback mechanism activations
- Error occurrences and recovery strategies

These logs create a **complete reasoning trace**, enabling:

1. **Formative feedback** — personalized debriefs showing learners their questioning patterns, revealed information sequence, and bias-prone moments

2. **Summative evaluation** — objective assessment of diagnostic accuracy, information gathering thoroughness, and bias awareness

3. **Research analytics** — large-scale studies of interaction patterns, identification of common reasoning errors, and evaluation of pedagogical interventions

By embedding reproducibility at the data layer, SmartDoc ensures that each learning session doubles as a research opportunity. This addresses the call in Chapter 3 for more transparent and empirically grounded evaluation of AI-powered virtual patients.

## Example: Reasoning Trace from Real Session

  }
}
```

This structured capture enables both immediate educational use (student review, instructor feedback) and downstream research analysis (pattern mining, intervention effectiveness studies).

## Data Privacy and Security Considerations

Although SmartDoc is a research prototype, data protection principles were embedded from initial design:

**Access Control:**
- Role-based authentication (students, instructors, administrators)
- Session isolation — learners access only their own data
- Instructor dashboards with aggregated analytics

**Data Minimization:**
- No personally identifiable medical information
- Simulated cases only (no real patient data)
- Optional anonymization for research datasets

**Audit Trails:**
- All data access logged with timestamps and user IDs
- Administrative actions (user creation, data export) fully traced
- Modification history preserved for critical records

**Local Storage:**
- All data stored locally, no external transmission
- LLM processing entirely local (Ollama), no cloud API calls
- Database backups encrypted at rest

These safeguards align with educational research ethics requirements and demonstrate that pedagogical innovation need not compromise learner privacy.
# 4.2.5 Deployment Configuration and Scalability

A critical requirement for SmartDoc is reliable deployment in both research and educational settings. The deployment architecture was designed with three guiding principles:

1. **Reproducibility** — ensuring that the same configuration can be reproduced across different sites and machines
2. **Scalability** — enabling the platform to support cohorts of learners by scaling model inference capacity when needed
3. **Accessibility** — minimizing technical barriers for institutions, favoring lightweight setups that do not require specialized infrastructure

## Containerization and Reproducibility

To guarantee consistent behavior across environments, the system is distributed as containerized services using Docker. This encapsulation ensures that all dependencies are versioned and portable, allowing educational institutions or research collaborators to reproduce experiments without lengthy installation procedures.

**Table 4.6: Docker Container Components**

| Component | Technology | Role | Configuration |
|-----------|-----------|------|---------------|
| Web Application | Flask + Gunicorn | HTTP server for API and static files | 4 worker processes, port 8000 |
| LLM Inference | Ollama | Local model hosting with GPU acceleration | Gemma 3:4b-it-q4_K_M loaded in memory |
| Database | SQLite | Persistent storage with ACID guarantees | Single-file, ~50MB typical size |
| CORS Middleware | Flask-CORS | Cross-origin request support | Development frontend access enabled |
| Logging System | Python logging | Structured audit trail | JSON format, daily rotation, 7-day retention |

### Container Definition

The primary application container is built on `python:3.13-slim` base image and includes:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    gcc \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Ollama
RUN curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Install Python dependencies via Poetry
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN pip install poetry && poetry install --no-root --no-dev

# Copy application code
COPY apps/api /app/api
COPY packages/ /app/packages

# Expose ports
EXPOSE 8000

# Startup script
CMD ["./start.sh"]
```

### Startup Sequence

The container initialization follows a deterministic sequence to ensure all components are operational before accepting requests:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# start.sh

# 1. Start Ollama service in background
ollama serve &

# 2. Wait for Ollama to be ready
sleep 5

# 3. Load LLM models into memory
ollama pull gemma3:4b-it-q4_K_M

# 4. Initialize database (run migrations)
cd /app/api
poetry run alembic upgrade head

# 5. Start Flask application via Gunicorn
poetry run gunicorn \
    --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 \
    --workers 4 \
    --timeout 120 \
    --access-logfile /app/logs/access.log \
    --error-logfile /app/logs/error.log \
    smartdoc_api:app
```

This sequence ensures that LLM models are pre-loaded (avoiding cold-start latency during first student query) and the database schema is current.

## Model Hosting and Flexibility

SmartDoc supports two deployment modes to accommodate different institutional contexts:

### Local Hosting (Research/Privacy-Focused)

**Configuration:**
- Ollama running within the application container
- Gemma 3:4b quantized model (~3GB memory)
- GPU acceleration via NVIDIA Container Toolkit (optional but recommended)
- No internet connectivity required after initial model download

**Advantages:**
- Complete data privacy (no external API calls)
- Reproducible model behavior (fixed version)
- No API costs
- Suitable for research studies requiring exact replication

**Limitations:**
- Requires capable hardware (8GB+ RAM, GPU recommended)
- Lower accuracy than state-of-the-art commercial models
- Self-managed updates and maintenance

### Cloud Hosting (Production-Scale)

**Configuration:**
- Provider abstraction switched to OpenAI or Anthropic
- API keys managed via environment variables
- Model selection: GPT-4o-mini or Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Rate limiting and cost controls enabled

**Advantages:**
- State-of-the-art model performance
- No local hardware requirements
- Automatic scaling
- Professional reliability and uptime

**Limitations:**
- API costs per inference
- Data transmitted to external services
- Potential latency from network round-trips
- Model updates may change behavior

The dual-mode design reflects a balance between cost, accuracy, and data governance, allowing institutions to select the configuration best suited to their pedagogical and ethical context.

## Scalability Considerations

Although individual learners typically interact with SmartDoc in isolation, classroom or cohort settings require concurrent session support. The architecture supports horizontal scaling through several mechanisms:

### Application Scaling

Gunicorn worker processes enable concurrent request handling:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  smartdoc-api:
    build: .
    environment:
      GUNICORN_WORKERS: 4  # Adjust based on CPU cores
      GUNICORN_TIMEOUT: 120
    deploy:
      replicas: 2  # Multiple container instances
```

### LLM Inference Scaling

For local deployment, multiple Ollama instances can be launched in parallel:

```yaml
services:
  ollama-1:
    image: ollama/ollama
    ports: ["11434:11434"]
    
  ollama-2:
    image: ollama/ollama
    ports: ["11435:11434"]
    
  smartdoc-api:
    environment:
      OLLAMA_HOSTS: "http://ollama-1:11434,http://ollama-2:11434"
```

Load balancing distributes inference requests across instances, reducing wait times.

### Database Considerations

SQLite is sufficient for cohorts up to ~50 concurrent users. For larger deployments, migration to PostgreSQL is straightforward via SQLAlchemy:

```python
# Minimal configuration change
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///smartdoc.db")
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
```

PostgreSQL supports thousands of concurrent connections and enables distributed deployments across multiple servers.

## Persistent Storage and Operational Logging

Two Docker volumes ensure data persistence across container restarts:

```yaml
volumes:
  smartdoc-data:
    # Database files, session state
    driver: local
    
  smartdoc-logs:
    # Application logs, audit trails
    driver: local
```

### Database Volume

Stores the complete SQLite database file. Backed up automatically via cron job every 24 hours:

```bash
# Backup script
#!/bin/bash
timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
cp /app/data/smartdoc.db /app/backups/smartdoc_$timestamp.db
# Retain last 7 backups
ls -t /app/backups/smartdoc_*.db | tail -n +8 | xargs rm -f
```

### Logs Volume

Gathers comprehensive operational logs:

- **Application logs** — Flask route handling, request/response cycles
- **LLM inference logs** — prompt/completion pairs, inference times, token counts
- **Error traces** — stack traces, exception contexts, recovery actions
- **Audit logs** — user authentication, data access, administrative actions

Log files are structured JSON for machine parsing:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T22:47:52.289182Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "module": "intent_classifier",
  "event": "classification_success",
  "data": {
    "query": "What is her past medical history?",
    "intent": "pmh_general",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "inference_time_ms": 234
  }
}
```

This enables programmatic analysis of system behavior and identification of performance bottlenecks.

## Educational Impact of Deployment Design

By prioritizing reproducibility and portability, SmartDoc enables institutions to adopt the platform with minimal setup, making bias-aware clinical simulation accessible beyond well-resourced centers. The containerization approach means that:

- **Technical staff** can deploy SmartDoc with a single `docker-compose up` command
- **Researchers** can replicate study environments exactly across multiple sites
- **Educators** can run the system on laptops for small workshops or on servers for entire courses

The scalability features ensure that response times remain low (<2 seconds per interaction), preserving immersion and educational value even with larger groups. The emphasis on local deployment and data privacy reinforces trust in the system for formal training contexts.

Together, these deployment choices demonstrate that architectural decisions are not merely technical concerns but **educational enablers**, supporting widespread adoption and rigorous empirical evaluation of diagnostic reasoning pedagogy.
# 4.3 Example Workflow: The Miliary Tuberculosis Case

This section illustrates a complete diagnostic workflow through SmartDoc using real session data (Session SESS_0W451OZEJ, conducted October 13, 2025). This case demonstrates how the system's design principles translate into educational practice, showing the interplay between intent classification, progressive disclosure, educational scaffolding, bias detection, and metacognitive evaluation.

## 4.3.1 Case Overview and Educational Objectives

The case adapts Mull et al.'s published example of diagnostic error, where an elderly Spanish-speaking woman with dyspnea was repeatedly misdiagnosed with heart failure due to cognitive biases. SmartDoc transforms this case report into an interactive learning experience that makes bias tangible and addressable.

**Initial Presentation:**
> "A 65-year-old woman presents with worsening shortness of breath over 2 months. Her son provides the history. She has a history of 'heart failure.'"

**Educational Objectives:**
1. Practice systematic information gathering across history, examination, and investigations
2. Recognize anchoring bias (initial "heart failure" framing)
3. Demonstrate medication reconciliation in complex patients
4. Integrate contradictory evidence (normal echo vs. elevated BNP)
5. Identify the critical diagnostic clue (immunosuppressant use)

**Correct Diagnosis:** Miliary tuberculosis secondary to TNF-α inhibitor therapy

**Common Misdiagnosis:** Acute heart failure exacerbation (anchoring trap)

## 4.3.2 Phase-by-Phase Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Anamnesis (Interactions 1-10, Duration: 7 minutes)

The student begins systematic history-taking, demonstrating generally good clinical reasoning:

**Interaction 1 — Past Medical History**

> Student: "First, what is her past medical history?"  
> Intent: `pmh_general` (confidence 0.95)  
> Son: "Uh, she has a history of morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis."

**Discovery Event:** Block `pmh_comorbidities` revealed (category: presenting_symptoms)

The student appropriately begins with foundational information. The rheumatoid arthritis mention is critical but does not immediately reveal the connection to immunosuppressant therapy.

**Interaction 2 — Chief Complaint**

> Student: "And what brings you here today?"  
> Intent: `hpi_chief_complaint` (confidence 0.95)  
> Son: "Uh, she's been having trouble breathing, especially when she's trying to do things. And she has a cough, but it's not bringing up anything."

**Discovery Event:** Block `hpi_dyspnea_details` revealed

**Interaction 3 — Symptom Duration**

> Student: "For how long is she having trouble breathing?"  
> Intent: `hpi_onset_duration_primary` (confidence 0.95)  
> Son: "Uh, it's been gradually worsening for about two months, you know? It hasn't gotten suddenly worse, just slowly."

**Discovery Event:** Block `hpi_onset_duration` revealed

The gradual two-month progression argues against acute cardiac decompensation, though many students do not recognize this initially.

**Interaction 4 — Current Medications**

> Student: "Any regular medication?"  
> Intent: `meds_current_known` (confidence 0.95)  
> Son: "Uh, she's currently taking lisinopril, atenolol, glipizide, and metformin, I think. I'm not sure about anything else she might be on."

**Discovery Event:** Block `meds_initial_known` revealed (Level 1)

Note the son's uncertainty ("I think", "I'm not sure about anything else"), which models realistic family member recall and foreshadows the need for deeper medication reconciliation.

**Critical Interaction 5 — RA Medications (First Attempt)**

> Student: "And is she taking anything for her rheumatoid arthritis?"  
> Intent: `meds_ra_specific_initial_query` (confidence 0.98)  
> Son: "Uh, I'm not sure I have information about that specifically. I don't have records of what she's taking for her rheumatoid arthritis, I'm sorry."

**Discovery Event:** Block `meds_ra_uncertainty` revealed (Level 2)

This response creates productive frustration—the student recognizes that RA treatment information exists but is not immediately available. The system is testing whether the learner will persist.

**Interactions 6-8 — Constitutional Symptoms**

The student systematically evaluates constitutional symptoms:

> "Does she have fevers?" → No (`hpi_fever`)  
> "What about night chills?" → No (`hpi_chills`)  
> "Any pain? On the chest?" → No (`hpi_chest_pain`)

**Discovery Events:** Three pertinent negative blocks revealed

This thorough evaluation of negatives demonstrates good clinical reasoning. However, the absence of fever and chills may inappropriately reduce suspicion for infectious etiology (tuberculosis can present without fever).

### Phase 2: Physical Examination (Interactions 9-11, Duration: 3 minutes)

**Interaction 9 — Vital Signs**

> Student: "Vital signs"  
> Intent: `exam_vital` (confidence 0.95)  
> System: "Vital signs: Temperature 99.9°F (37.7°C), HR 105, BP 140/70, RR 24, O2 sat 89% on room air."

**Discovery Event:** Block `exam_vital` revealed

The low-grade temperature (99.9°F) and hypoxia (89% O2) are concerning but nonspecific. Many students fixate on the tachycardia and hypertension, reinforcing cardiac hypotheses.

**Interaction 10 — Cardiac Examination**

> Student: "cardiac sound"  
> Intent: `exam_cardiovascular` (confidence 0.98)  
> System: "Heart sounds are normal and there is no lower-extremity edema."

**Discovery Event:** Block `exam_cardiac_negative` revealed

Normal cardiac examination is actually **contradictory evidence** against heart failure, though students often overlook this.

**Interaction 11 — Pulmonary Examination**

> Student: "lung sounds"  
> Intent: `exam_respiratory` (confidence 0.98)  
> System: "Pulmonary examination demonstrates crackles in all lung fields."

**Discovery Event:** Block `exam_respiratory` revealed

Diffuse crackles can occur in both pulmonary edema (heart failure) and interstitial lung disease (including miliary TB). This finding is ambiguous.

### Phase 3: Investigations (Interactions 12-17, Duration: 8 minutes)

**Interaction 12 — Initial Imaging (ANCHORING TRAP)**

> Student: "is there any chest x-ray?"  
> Intent: `imaging_chest_xray` (confidence 0.95)  
> System: "Yes, a preliminary chest radiograph was obtained. The interpretation is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion."

**Discovery Event:** Block `imaging_cxr_preliminary` revealed  
**BIAS TRIGGER ACTIVATED:** Anchoring on "pulmonary vascular congestion" → heart failure hypothesis

**Bias Warning #1 Triggered** (timestamp: 22:53:42)  
Type: Anchoring  
Description: "Focus on cardiac hypothesis after chest X-ray interpretation"

The preliminary radiology interpretation creates a powerful anchor. Many students stop investigating at this point, having "confirmed" their heart failure hypothesis.

**Critical Interaction 13 — Medication Reconciliation (Second Attempt)**

> Student: "Are you sure that your mother is not on any biologics or immunosuppressive medications?"  
> Intent: `meds_ra_specific_initial_query` (confidence 0.95)

**Educational Scaffold Deployed:**

> Son: "Like I said, I'm not sure about her rheumatoid arthritis medications. **Maybe you could check her previous hospital records?** I know she's had some treatments at other facilities."

This is the second attempt with similar intent, triggering the educational hint mechanism. The system guides the student toward medication reconciliation **without revealing the answer**.

**Critical Interaction 14 — Medication Reconciliation (Success!)**

> Student: "Can you get her complete medication list from previous hospitalizations?"  
> Intent: `meds_full_reconciliation_query` (confidence 0.98)  
> Son: "Uh, yes, she was receiving **infliximab** for rheumatoid arthritis. That's the only medication listed from her previous hospital stays, as far as I know."

**Discovery Event:** Block `critical_infliximab` revealed (Level 3, **critical finding**)

**This is the diagnostic key.** Infliximab (TNF-α inhibitor) substantially increases tuberculosis reactivation risk. Students who reach this information are significantly more likely to arrive at the correct diagnosis.

**Interaction 15 — Advanced Imaging**

> Student: "Can we have a computed tomography scan?"  
> Intent: `imaging_ct_chest` (confidence 0.95)  
> System: "The chest X-ray demonstrates a reticular pattern with innumerable, tiny, 1- to 2-mm pulmonary nodules. We can order a computed tomography scan of the chest to further characterize these findings. Would you like me to proceed with that order?"

**Discovery Event:** Block `critical_ct_chest` revealed (re-interpretation of imaging)

The system reveals that the CT shows **miliary nodules** (1-2mm), not simple vascular congestion. This is **contradictory evidence** that should prompt reconsideration of the heart failure hypothesis.

**Interaction 16 — Laboratory Studies**

> Student: "Bloodwork?"  
> Intent: `labs_general` (confidence 0.95)  
> System: "The cardiac lab results show a pro-BNP level greater than the upper limit of normal. We also have an elevated white blood cell count of 13.0 x 10^9/L and a low hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL. I recommend further investigation into the etiology of the anemia and leukocytosis."

**Discovery Events:** Blocks `labs_bnp`, `labs_wbc`, `labs_hemoglobin` revealed

The elevated BNP is a **red herring** that reinforces the cardiac hypothesis, while the leukocytosis actually suggests infection/inflammation.

**Interaction 17 — Echocardiogram (CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE)**

> Student: "Echocardiogram?"  
> Intent: `imaging_echo` (confidence 0.95)  
> System: "The echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction with no evidence of elevated filling pressures."

**Discovery Event:** Block `critical_echo` revealed (**contradicts heart failure**)

**This is the decisive contradictory finding.** Normal ejection fraction and filling pressures effectively rule out heart failure as the primary cause of dyspnea. Students who integrate this evidence correctly will abandon the cardiac hypothesis.

### Summary of Information Revealed

**Table 4.7: Discoveries by Category and Timing**

| Category | Count | Critical Findings | Timeline |
|----------|-------|------------------|----------|
| Presenting Symptoms | 6 | None | First 2 minutes |
| Current Medications | 3 | Infliximab (min 7) | Throughout anamnesis |
| Physical Examination | 3 | None | Minutes 7-10 |
| Imaging | 3 | Miliary nodules, Normal echo | Minutes 10-15 |
| Diagnostic Results | 3 | None (BNP is misleading) | Minutes 15-18 |
| **Total** | **18** | **2 critical** | **18 minutes** |

## 4.3.3 Diagnosis and Reflection

After completing the investigation, the student submitted:

**Diagnosis:** "miliary tuberculosis"

**Reflection Responses:**

1. **Most compelling evidence:**
   > "The chest CT showing tiny pulmonary nodules in a diffuse reticular pattern, in combination with the patient's recent infliximab therapy, is the most compelling evidence supporting miliary tuberculosis. This imaging pattern is classic for disseminated hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and TNF alpha inhibitor therapy significantly increases the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis."

2. **Evidence against diagnosis:**
   > "An elevated BNP and crackles on auscultation could suggest heart failure but these findings are nonspecific and can occur in many conditions involving lung parenchymal disease or inflammation. The absence of peripheral edema and the normal cardiac exam make a cardiac origin of her dyspnea unlikely."

3. **Alternative diagnoses:**
   > "Acute heart failure exacerbation; Interstitial lung disease (possibly secondary to rheumatoid arthritis or drug toxicity)"

4. **How to rule in/out alternatives:**
   > "The echocardiogram evaluating left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, as well as filling pressures, would decisively clarify whether cardiac dysfunction explains the symptoms. In this case, the normal ejection fraction and absence of elevated filling pressures effectively rule out acute heart failure as the cause of dyspnea."

5. **Must-not-miss conditions considered:**
   > "I considered and systematically excluded acute heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and severe bacterial pneumonia. The chronic and progressive nature of the patient's symptoms, absence of pleuritic pain or focal infiltrates, and the imaging pattern all argue against these."

## 4.3.4 Evaluation Results

**Overall Score:** 81/100

**Dimensional Scores:**
- **Information Gathering:** 75/100
- **Diagnostic Accuracy:** 88/100
- **Cognitive Bias Awareness:** 80/100

**Evaluator Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- Correct diagnosis, avoiding the heart failure trap
- Recognition of infliximab's role in TB reactivation
- Systematic exclusion of alternative diagnoses
- Good integration of contradictory evidence (normal echo)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- More explicit documentation of weight loss and constitutional symptoms
- Deeper exploration of how anchoring bias influenced initial assessment
- More detailed discussion of how to prevent similar errors in future cases

**Key Recommendation:**
> "Implement a structured approach to medication reconciliation, specifically focusing on immunosuppressant therapies and their potential impact on infectious disease risk. Develop a checklist to ensure all relevant medications are considered during the diagnostic process. Practice actively challenging initial interpretations, particularly when they are influenced by readily available data (e.g., CXR findings)."

## 4.3.5 Educational Impact Analysis

This session demonstrates several key features of SmartDoc's design:

### Progressive Disclosure Success

The student revealed 18 information blocks through 17 queries, demonstrating active information seeking rather than passive consumption. The medication reconciliation escalation (Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3) required persistence and semantic precision, rewarding expert-level inquiry behavior.

### Educational Scaffolding Effectiveness

The dynamic hint after the second RA medication query successfully guided the student toward medication reconciliation (reaching Level 3). Without this scaffold, 58% of students in pilot testing failed to discover the infliximab clue.

### Bias Demonstration

The case successfully created an anchoring opportunity (preliminary CXR interpretation suggesting heart failure). The bias warning triggered when the student focused heavily on cardiac explanations, though the student ultimately overcame the bias by pursuing additional investigations (CT, echo).

### Metacognitive Reflection Quality

The student's reflection responses demonstrate:
- **Evidence integration:** Connected infliximab to TB risk
- **Contradiction acknowledgment:** Recognized normal echo refutes heart failure
- **Alternative consideration:** Listed reasonable differential diagnoses
- **Systematic thinking:** Explained reasoning for ruling out alternatives

The quality of reflection suggests that the structured prompts successfully elicited deliberate, analytic reasoning (System 2), fulfilling the pedagogical objective of making diagnostic thinking explicit and improvable.

### System Performance

- **Intent classification:** 17/17 intents correctly classified (100%)
- **Average confidence:** 0.96 (high reliability)
- **Response latency:** <2s per interaction (maintained immersion)
- **Educational hint deployment:** 1/1 successful (student escalated appropriately)
- **Bias detection:** 1/1 trigger appropriate (anchoring correctly identified)

This case demonstrates that SmartDoc's design successfully operationalizes the principles of progressive disclosure, educational scaffolding, bias detection, and metacognitive assessment in authentic diagnostic practice.
# 4.4 Summary

This chapter has presented the complete architecture and implementation of SmartDoc, an AI-powered clinical simulation platform designed to address the cognitive bias problem identified in Chapters 2 and 3. The system represents a novel synthesis of cognitive psychology principles (dual-process theory, metacognition), artificial intelligence techniques (large language models, intent classification), and medical education pedagogy (progressive disclosure, structured reflection).

## 4.4.1 Key Contributions

### Conceptual Innovations

**Intent-Driven Progressive Disclosure**  
SmartDoc introduces a 33-intent classification system that connects student queries to information revelation dynamically. Unlike traditional static case presentations or simple keyword matching, this approach rewards semantic precision and clinical expertise, creating graduated information barriers that model real-world diagnostic uncertainty.

**Embedded Bias Detection**  
The system makes cognitive bias tangible through **bias triggers** built directly into clinical cases. Rather than explaining bias abstractly, SmartDoc creates situations where anchoring, confirmation bias, and premature closure naturally emerge, then provides real-time metacognitive prompts that make invisible reasoning processes explicit.

**Educational Scaffolding with Escalation Levels**  
The medication reconciliation example (Levels 1→2→3) demonstrates how SmartDoc guides students toward critical insights without eliminating diagnostic challenge. Dynamic hints provide just-in-time support that maintains learner agency while preventing dead ends—a balance difficult to achieve in traditional simulation designs.

### Technical Achievements

**Production-Grade LLM Integration**  
Chapter 4 documented the complete pipeline from initial prototype (57% accuracy on past medical history classification) to production deployment (95% accuracy). Key refinements included context-aware filtering, structured output parsing with retry mechanisms, and temperature optimization per module (0.3 for classification/evaluation, 0.5 for dialogue generation).

**Multi-Responder Architecture**  
The design of three specialized responders (AnamnesisSon, LabsResident, ExamObjective) demonstrates domain-specific prompt engineering that balances realism with educational value. Production refinements reduced clarification requests by 40% and eliminated 89% of strange responses while maintaining conversational authenticity.

**Comprehensive Logging for Reproducibility**  
The dual-layer state management system (session memory + event-driven logging) enables complete reasoning trace reconstruction. This design choice supports both immediate educational feedback and longitudinal research analysis, addressing a critical gap in AI-VP evaluation methodology identified in Chapter 3.

## 4.4.2 Design Principles Validated

The miliary tuberculosis case (Section 4.3) demonstrates how SmartDoc's design principles operate in authentic diagnostic practice:

1. **Authenticity:** The son persona's uncertainty ("I'm not sure", "I think") models realistic family member communication, creating genuine need for medication reconciliation rather than artificial puzzle-solving.

2. **Bias Awareness:** The preliminary chest X-ray interpretation ("pulmonary vascular congestion") creates an authentic anchoring opportunity. Students must actively challenge this interpretation rather than passively receive correct information.

3. **Structured Reflection:** The five metacognitive prompts elicited evidence-based reasoning ("The chest CT showing tiny pulmonary nodules...in combination with infliximab therapy") rather than rote recall, fulfilling Schön's vision of reflective practice in medical education.

## 4.4.3 Addressing Chapter 3 Gaps

Chapter 3 identified three major limitations in existing AI-VP research:

**Limited Evaluation Rigor**  
SmartDoc addresses this through structured diagnostic accuracy assessment (correct diagnosis, supporting evidence, alternative diagnoses), cognitive bias awareness measurement (session pattern analysis, metacognitive reflection quality), and complete session logging for reproducibility.

**Absence of Cognitive Bias Integration**  
Unlike existing AI-VPs that focus solely on knowledge transfer, SmartDoc explicitly targets dual-process reasoning. The system creates conditions where System 1 thinking leads to error (e.g., anchoring on "heart failure" framing), then provides metacognitive scaffolds that engage System 2 deliberation.

**Lack of Technical Transparency**  
This chapter provides complete algorithmic specifications (Algorithms 1-2), empirical performance data (Tables 4.2, 4.5), and production refinement documentation. Future researchers can replicate, validate, or extend SmartDoc's design based on the technical details provided.

## 4.4.4 Limitations and Design Trade-offs

### Single-Case Implementation

The current SmartDoc prototype focuses deeply on one clinical case (miliary tuberculosis). This design choice prioritizes pedagogical depth over breadth—students experience one case with comprehensive educational scaffolding rather than many cases with shallow interaction.

**Trade-off:** High educational value per case vs. limited content variety  
**Future Direction:** Template-based case authoring to enable educator-created content

### Intent Classification Constraints

The 33-intent taxonomy represents clinical reasoning comprehensively but requires maintenance as medical language evolves. Production data revealed unanticipated query phrasings ("cardiac sound" vs. "heart examination") requiring iterative refinement.

**Trade-off:** Semantic precision rewarding expertise vs. potential frustration from unrecognized intents  
**Future Direction:** Continuous learning from session logs to expand intent recognition

### LLM Dependency

SmartDoc relies on Ollama with Gemma 3:4b for all dynamic components (intent classification, response generation, diagnosis evaluation). This creates reproducibility advantages (local deployment, version control) but limits system capability to the underlying model's performance.

**Trade-off:** Local deployment and data privacy vs. state-of-the-art model performance  
**Future Direction:** Provider abstraction enables model upgrades without architectural changes

### Bias Detection Specificity

The current bias detection system focuses on three major bias types (anchoring, confirmation, premature closure) with rule-based triggers. More subtle biases (availability heuristic, representativeness) require pattern analysis difficult to implement reliably.

**Trade-off:** High-precision detection of major biases vs. incomplete coverage of all cognitive errors  
**Future Direction:** Machine learning-based bias detection trained on expert-labeled sessions

## 4.4.5 Bridge to Chapter 5

This chapter has described **what SmartDoc does** (intent-driven simulation with bias detection) and **how it works** (LLM integration, progressive disclosure, multi-responder architecture). Chapter 5 addresses the critical question: **Does it work?**

The evaluation study presents empirical evidence from 42 medical students using SmartDoc to diagnose the miliary tuberculosis case. Chapter 5 will examine:

- **Diagnostic Performance:** How many students reached the correct diagnosis vs. fell into the heart failure trap?
- **Bias Awareness:** Did metacognitive reflection improve recognition of anchoring and confirmation bias?
- **Information Gathering Quality:** Did intent-driven disclosure lead to more systematic investigations than traditional case presentations?
- **User Experience:** How did students perceive SmartDoc's educational value, realism, and usability?

Importantly, Chapter 5 will also analyze **failures**—sessions where SmartDoc did not achieve its educational objectives—to identify when and why the system's design breaks down. This critical examination will inform both the interpretation of study results and recommendations for future AI-VP development in medical education.

---

**Chapter 4 has established SmartDoc's theoretical foundation and technical implementation. The system now advances to empirical validation, where design principles meet the complexity of actual clinical reasoning in medical learners.**
# 4.2.6 User Interfaces

SmartDoc's user-facing components translate the technical architecture into accessible, pedagogically effective interfaces. The design philosophy prioritizes **cognitive focus** over visual complexity—students should concentrate on clinical reasoning rather than navigating complex software. This section describes the two primary interfaces: the simulation environment for students and the administrative dashboard for educators.

## 4.2.6.1 Simulation Interface

The simulation interface presents as a single-page web application accessible through any modern browser. The design deliberately avoids medical record system mimicry, instead providing a clean, distraction-free environment that foregrounds diagnostic thinking.

### Layout and Core Components

**Three-Panel Organization:**

1. **Patient Information Panel** (left, 25% width)

   - Case title and chief complaint
   - Basic demographics and presenting context
   - Always visible for quick reference
   - Styled as a persistent sidebar

2. **Interaction Panel** (center, 50% width)

   - Chat-based conversation with the patient's son
   - Scrollable conversation history with visual distinction between student queries (right-aligned, blue) and system responses (left-aligned, gray)
   - Input field with suggestion buttons for common query types ("Ask about medications", "Request vital signs", "Order imaging")
   - Real-time typing indicators during LLM processing

3. **Discovery Panel** (right, 25% width)
   - Running list of revealed information organized by category
   - Visual indicators for critical findings (amber icon) and contradictory evidence (purple icon)
   - Bias warnings appear here as persistent cards
   - Collapsible sections to manage information density

### Tabbed Investigation Views

Below the main conversation panel, three tabs organize different types of clinical information:

**Anamnesis Tab**

- History of present illness
- Past medical history
- Current medications
- Social history
- Review of systems

Each piece of information appears only after the student asks the relevant question, with timestamps showing when it was revealed.

**Physical Examination Tab**

- Vital signs
- General appearance
- System-by-system examination findings

Examination findings populate dynamically based on student requests, mirroring real clinical workflow where you see only what you examine.

**Diagnostic Results Tab**

- Laboratory values
- Imaging reports
- Special tests (echocardiogram, etc.)

Results appear in chronological order of request, not grouped by type, reinforcing the temporal nature of diagnostic investigation.

### Bias Warning Display

When the bias detection system identifies a concerning pattern, a **bias warning card** appears in the Discovery Panel with the following structure:

```
⚠️ COGNITIVE BIAS DETECTED

Type: Anchoring Bias

Pattern: You have focused heavily on the cardiac hypothesis
after the initial chest X-ray interpretation suggested
pulmonary vascular congestion. Consider whether you are
giving sufficient weight to contradictory evidence (e.g.,
normal cardiac examination) or alternative explanations
for the patient's symptoms.

Recommendation: Before proceeding, explicitly list
evidence that DOES NOT support your current leading
diagnosis.
```

The warning remains visible but non-blocking—students can continue investigating without dismissing it. This design choice reflects the pedagogical goal of making bias awareness metacognitively salient without punishing learners or creating frustration.

### Diagnosis Submission Interface

When the student feels ready to conclude the case, clicking "Submit Diagnosis" reveals a structured form with five metacognitive prompts:

1. **What is your diagnosis?**
   Free text, allowing students to express diagnostic certainty or uncertainty naturally.

2. **What evidence most strongly supports your diagnosis?**
   Forces explicit articulation of reasoning, preventing "gut feeling" diagnoses.

3. **What evidence argues against your diagnosis?**
   Prompts consideration of contradictory data, engaging System 2 deliberation.

4. **What alternative diagnoses did you consider?**
   Assesses differential diagnosis breadth and systematic thinking.

5. **How would you rule in or rule out these alternatives?**
   Evaluates understanding of diagnostic test characteristics and clinical decision-making.

Upon submission, the interface transitions to the evaluation results view (described below).

## 4.2.6.2 Evaluation Results Interface

After diagnosis submission, students receive comprehensive feedback organized into three sections:

### Overall Performance Summary

A prominent score display shows:

- **Overall Score:** Large number (e.g., 81/100) with color coding (red <60, yellow 60-79, green ≥80)
- **Dimensional Breakdown:** Three sub-scores for Information Gathering, Diagnostic Accuracy, and Cognitive Bias Awareness
- **Performance Tier:** Text label (e.g., "Strong Performance", "Needs Improvement")

### Detailed Evaluation

**Strengths Section:**

- Bulleted list of specific things the student did well
- Quotes from their reflection responses highlighting good reasoning
- Recognition of correct diagnostic conclusions or systematic approaches

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Specific, actionable feedback on what to do differently
- Identification of missed critical findings
- Analysis of bias patterns observed in the session

**Key Recommendations:**

- 1-2 concrete strategies for future cases
- Emphasis on generalizable skills (e.g., "Implement structured medication reconciliation") rather than case-specific facts

### Session Summary Statistics

A data table showing:

- Total interactions: 17
- Information blocks revealed: 18
- Critical findings discovered: 2/2 (100%)
- Bias warnings triggered: 1
- Session duration: 18 minutes
- Average response time: <2 seconds

This quantitative summary helps students understand their investigation pattern and efficiency.

## 4.2.6.3 Administrative Dashboard

The administrative interface provides educators and researchers with comprehensive system management capabilities. Access is restricted via authentication (simple password protection in the research prototype, designed for easy extension to institutional SSO). The dashboard is organized into six primary functional areas.

### Database Backup and Management

**Database Download:**
- One-click download of complete SQLite database file
- Includes all user sessions, conversations, diagnoses, and evaluations
- Enables offline analysis and data archival
- Critical for research data preservation and institutional backup policies

This backup capability ensures that research data remains accessible even if the hosted instance becomes unavailable, supporting reproducibility requirements for academic research.

### System Configuration

**Bias Warning and Discovery Counter Visibility:**

A critical feature for research studies is the ability to control the visibility of metacognitive scaffolding elements:

- **Hide Bias Warnings:** Checkbox to suppress real-time cognitive bias alerts
- **Hide Discovery Counters:** Checkbox to conceal information revelation tracking

**Implementation:**
```html
<input type="checkbox" id="hide-bias-warnings" />
Hide Bias Warnings (for research studies)
```

When enabled, the configuration is stored server-side via `/api/v1/config` endpoint and retrieved by the simulation interface on load. The frontend then:

1. Hides all elements with class `bias-related` (discovery counters, bias warning cards)
2. Prevents bias warning popups from appearing
3. Logs all suppressed warnings to browser console for debugging
4. Continues recording bias events in the database for analysis

**Research Rationale:**  
This feature enables controlled experiments comparing diagnostic performance with and without metacognitive scaffolding. By hiding bias warnings from a control group while maintaining identical case difficulty, researchers can isolate the educational impact of real-time bias feedback. All bias events remain logged in the database regardless of visibility, ensuring complete data collection for both experimental conditions.

### Users Management

**User Creation:**
- Form-based user registration with required fields:
  - Display name and email
  - Age and sex (for demographic analysis)
  - Role (user/admin)
  - Medical experience level (student, resident, attending)
  - Label/cohort identifier (e.g., "pilot", "cohort-2024")
- Automatic generation of unique access code for authentication
- Access code displayed once immediately after creation

**User Administration:**
- Table view showing all registered users with:
  - User ID, name, email, and role
  - Account status (active/inactive)
  - Usage statistics (number of sessions completed)
  - Creation timestamp
- Actions: View details, deactivate/reactivate, delete user
- Sortable and filterable by any column

**Purpose:**  
This management interface supports both educational deployment (creating student accounts) and research administration (organizing participants into cohorts, tracking completion rates).

### LLM Profile Configuration

**Profile Creation:**
- Define multiple LLM configurations for different use cases
- Configuration parameters:
  - Profile name (e.g., "Default GPT-4", "Research Gemma")
  - Provider selection (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - Model specification (e.g., "gemma3:4b-it-q4_K_M")
  - Temperature (0.0-2.0, controlling response creativity)
  - Top-p sampling parameter (0.0-1.0)
  - Max tokens (optional response length limit)
  - Default profile designation

**Profile Management:**
- Table view showing all configured LLM profiles
- Displays: ID, name, provider, model, temperature, top-p settings
- Indicates which profile is currently default
- Actions: Edit parameters, set as default, delete profile

**Use Cases:**
- **Production:** Stable, tested model configuration
- **Experimentation:** Testing new models or parameter combinations
- **A/B Testing:** Comparing different LLM configurations with identical prompts
- **Cost Optimization:** Switching between local (Ollama) and cloud providers

### Agent Prompt Management

**Prompt Creation:**
- Select agent type (Son/Patient Translator, Resident/Medical Assistant, Exam/Objective Findings)
- Associate with specific LLM profile or leave as "Default/Any"
- Text area for complete system prompt definition
- Automatic versioning of prompt iterations

**Prompt Administration:**
- Table view showing all agent prompts with:
  - Prompt ID and agent type
  - Associated LLM profile
  - Version number (automatically incremented)
  - Status (active/inactive)
  - Creation and last update timestamps
- Actions: View full prompt text, edit, activate/deactivate, delete

**Prompt Viewer Modal:**
- Detailed view displaying:
  - Agent type, LLM profile, version, status
  - Complete prompt text with syntax highlighting
  - Creation and update history
- Enables comparison between prompt versions for iterative refinement

**Research Application:**  
This feature enables systematic evaluation of different prompt engineering strategies. Researchers can test how variations in agent instructions affect response quality, maintaining version control of all prompt iterations used in published studies.

### Recent Activity Log

**Activity Monitoring:**
- Chronological table of recent administrative actions
- Logged events include:
  - User creation, modification, deletion
  - LLM profile configuration changes
  - Agent prompt updates
  - System configuration modifications
- Each entry shows:
  - Timestamp of action
  - Administrator user who performed action
  - Action type and description
  - Relevant details (e.g., which user was modified)

**Purpose:**  
Provides audit trail for research governance, troubleshooting system issues, and understanding usage patterns. Critical for institutional review board (IRB) compliance and research reproducibility documentation.

## 4.2.6.4 Design Rationale

### Minimalist Aesthetic

SmartDoc deliberately avoids elaborate graphics, animations, or complex navigation. This **cognitive minimalism** reflects educational research showing that extraneous visual elements can increase cognitive load and distract from learning objectives (Mayer's Coherence Principle, multimedia learning research).

**Design Choices:**

- White background with subtle gray panels
- Single clear font (system default sans-serif)
- Minimal color use (blue for user, gray for system, amber/purple for warnings)
- No background images or decorative elements

### Conversation-Centric Interaction

The chat-based interface mirrors familiar messaging applications, reducing the cognitive cost of learning to use the system. Students focus on **what to ask** rather than **how to ask it**, aligning with the pedagogical goal of improving clinical reasoning rather than software proficiency.

**Affordances:**

- Natural language input (no rigid command syntax)
- Suggestion buttons for common queries (scaffolding for novices)
- Persistent conversation history (supports System 2 reflection)
- Real-time feedback (maintains immersion)

### Transparent Discovery Tracking

Unlike traditional case simulations where students might wonder "did I miss something?", SmartDoc's Discovery Panel provides immediate feedback about information revelation. This transparency serves two educational purposes:

1. **Reduces anxiety:** Students know when they've discovered new information
2. **Encourages persistence:** Visual accumulation of discoveries rewards thorough investigation

The design makes **what you know** and **what you still need to learn** explicit, supporting metacognitive monitoring.

### Non-Punitive Bias Warnings

The bias warning system could have been designed to penalize students (e.g., score deductions) or block progression (e.g., forced acknowledgment). Instead, warnings appear as **informational advisories** that remain visible but non-blocking.

**Rationale:**

- Bias awareness is developmental—students need multiple exposures to recognize patterns
- Punishment could discourage hypothesis formation (reducing bias by eliminating thinking)
- Persistent visibility allows students to reflect on warnings after the fact

This design reflects a **formative assessment philosophy** where mistakes are learning opportunities rather than failures to be avoided.

### Structured Reflection Prompts

The five-question diagnosis submission form operationalizes metacognitive reflection without requiring students to understand cognitive psychology theory. Each prompt targets a specific aspect of diagnostic reasoning:

- **Question 1** (diagnosis): Decision-making
- **Question 2** (supporting evidence): Evidence integration
- **Question 3** (contradictory evidence): Bias awareness
- **Question 4** (alternatives): Differential diagnosis
- **Question 5** (ruling in/out): Diagnostic strategy

This structure ensures students engage System 2 deliberation regardless of their natural reflective tendency, addressing the problem that unreflective practitioners often don't know they need to reflect.

## 4.2.6.5 Implementation Details

### Frontend Technology

The simulation interface is implemented as a **static single-page application** using vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules), HTML5, and CSS3. This architecture choice prioritizes:

- **Simplicity:** No build step or framework dependencies
- **Portability:** Runs on any web server (including `python -m http.server`)
- **Transparency:** Source code is human-readable for educational inspection
- **Performance:** Minimal bundle size, fast load times

**Module Organization:**

```

    └── tabs.js         # Anamnesis/Exam/Labs tabs
```

### Responsive Design

The interface adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop (≥1200px):** Three-panel layout as described
- **Tablet (768-1199px):** Two-panel layout with collapsible patient info
- **Mobile (<768px):** Single-panel stacked layout with tab navigation

This responsiveness supports both classroom use (desktop monitors) and remote learning (laptops, tablets).

### Accessibility Considerations

While not the primary focus of the research prototype, basic accessibility features include:

- Semantic HTML (proper heading hierarchy, ARIA labels)
- Keyboard navigation support (tab order, enter to submit)
- High-contrast text (WCAG AA compliance)
- Screen reader compatibility for core content

Future production deployment would require comprehensive accessibility audit and remediation to meet institutional standards.

---

The user interface design reflects SmartDoc's core pedagogical philosophy: **make cognitive processes visible, support metacognitive reflection, and minimize extraneous cognitive load**. These principles translate technical capability into educational impact, completing the bridge between AI-powered backend systems and meaningful learning experiences for medical students.
# Chapter 4

# Developing SmartDoc: A Bias-Aware Clinical Simulation Platform

The gaps identified in Chapter 3, where AI-powered virtual patients show promise but lack mechanisms for explicit bias detection and metacognitive scaffolding, were used to inspire this project. Although numerous digital solutions exist for clinical simulation, the majority of these tools focus on knowledge transfer or procedural training rather than diagnostic reasoning under uncertainty. Bias-aware educational systems remain rare, and those that exist typically rely on post-hoc analysis rather than real-time intervention.

To address these gaps, this project proposes the development of SmartDoc, a conversational clinical simulation platform that enables medical students to practice diagnostic reasoning while receiving targeted feedback on cognitive biases. The system's aim is to provide a more authentic diagnostic experience than traditional virtual patients, while maintaining pedagogical rigor, by combining intent-driven information disclosure with large language models for natural dialogue, bias detection, and clinical evaluation.

The modern conversational AI architectures reviewed in Chapter 3 were analyzed to provide architectural direction. Fully end-to-end neural approaches were not considered suitable for high-stakes medical education since they lack transparency, do not constrain reasoning paths, and make validation of internal decision-making difficult. In contrast, hybrid systems that combine structured dialogue control with LLM capabilities proved that linguistic flexibility and pedagogical control can coexist, making such approaches more suitable for educational simulation systems.

This chapter describes the development of SmartDoc. **Part I** (Section 4.1) presents the conceptual system design and architectural principles. **Part II** (Section 4.2) details the technical implementation, including language model integration, database architecture, and deployment configuration. Section 4.3 illustrates a complete diagnostic workflow through a real clinical case, demonstrating how the design principles translate into educational practice. Finally, Section 4.4 summarizes the key contributions and bridges to the empirical evaluation presented in Chapter 5.
# 4.1 Part I: System Design

This first part presents the architectural principles and conceptual design of SmartDoc.

## 4.1.1 Overview

The SmartDoc system was inspired directly by the principles of progressive disclosure and metacognitive scaffolding outlined in Chapter 2. The system adopts a modular, rule-guided approach aligned with large language model capabilities. Unlike traditional virtual patients that follow predetermined branching scripts, SmartDoc enables free-form clinical inquiry while maintaining pedagogical control through intent-driven information revelation.

The platform implements three core pedagogical principles:

1. **Authenticity** — Realistic patient interactions through conversational interfaces that mimic genuine anamnesis, physical examination, and investigation ordering, bridging the theory-practice gap identified in Chapter 3.

2. **Bias Awareness** — Real-time detection of reasoning patterns associated with anchoring, confirmation bias, or premature closure, with targeted interventions that encourage reflection without disrupting immersion.

3. **Structured Reflection** — Embedded metacognitive checkpoints that support deliberate reflection and consolidation of diagnostic reasoning skills, operationalizing the debiasing strategies discussed in Chapter 2.

The architecture separates responsibilities into distinct layers:

- **Domain logic** — the reasoning engine and pedagogical rules that govern information disclosure and bias detection.
- **API layer** — orchestrating communication, state management, and coordination between modules.
- **Presentation layer** — the learner-facing interface for interacting with the virtual patient and receiving feedback.

At the core of the system lies the **Intent-Driven Disclosure Manager**, which orchestrates three essential processes:

1. **Understanding learner input** via an LLM-powered Intent Classifier that maps natural language queries to clinical intents,
2. **Controlling information flow** through a Discovery Processor that releases case data incrementally based on query specificity,
3. **Monitoring reasoning patterns** through a Bias Analyzer that detects bias-prone behaviors in real time and triggers metacognitive prompts.

This architecture ensures that the simulation reflects authentic diagnostic practice (as emphasized in Chapter 3) while embedding cognitive safeguards to mitigate common reasoning errors (Chapter 2). The modular design allows independent testing and validation of each component, addressing reproducibility concerns raised in the literature review.

## 4.1.2 Core Components

SmartDoc's architecture comprises seven interrelated modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the educational simulation.

### Intent Classifier

Learner utterances are mapped to a predefined taxonomy of 33 diagnostic intents (e.g., `pmh_general`, `exam_cardiovascular`, `imaging_chest_xray`, `meds_ra_specific_initial_query`). Rather than relying on rigid question trees or template matching, SmartDoc leverages natural language classification through an LLM, allowing students to phrase queries naturally. The classifier is context-aware, filtering available intents based on the current diagnostic phase (anamnesis, examination, or investigations), which improves accuracy and reduces ambiguity.

This module operationalizes **System 1 pattern recognition** while maintaining pathways for **System 2 monitoring**, as learners can freely explore hypotheses while the system tracks their reasoning trajectory.

### Discovery Processor

Clinical information is released progressively, linked directly to learner queries and their classified intents. Information is organized into modular **information blocks**, each representing a discrete clinical fact (e.g., vital signs, medication history, laboratory results). Blocks are annotated with metadata including:

- **Level** — depth of inquiry required (Level 1 = basic, Level 2+ = detailed follow-up),
- **Prerequisites** — other blocks that must be revealed first,
- **Critical flag** — whether the information is essential for correct diagnosis,
- **Intent triggers** — which clinical intents reveal this block.

This implements the principle of **progressive disclosure**, ensuring that data emerges as a result of active inquiry rather than passive reception. The design aligns with constructivist learning theory, promoting deep engagement over rote information consumption.

### Simulation Engine

The Simulation Engine orchestrates the entire learning loop, coordinating between all other modules:

> Student query → Intent classified → Discovery processing → Bias analysis → Response generation → Feedback assembly

It integrates reasoning traces with pedagogical scaffolds, ensuring each interaction is both educationally meaningful and technically coherent. The engine maintains session state, tracks revealed information, monitors hypothesis focus, and determines when educational interventions (hints, bias warnings, reflection prompts) should be deployed.

### Bias Analyzer

Bias detection is achieved through a combination of rule-based heuristics and LLM-based reasoning analysis. The module is directly grounded in the bias taxonomy presented in Section 2.2.2, with detection mechanisms for:

- **Anchoring bias** — persistence on initial hypotheses despite contradictory evidence,
- **Confirmation bias** — selective pursuit of supporting evidence while ignoring refuting information,
- **Premature closure** — stopping investigation too early before adequate data gathering.

Detection triggers are parameterized with thresholds calibrated during pilot testing. For example:

> IF hypothesis_focus > 70% on single diagnosis  
> AND contradictory_evidence revealed  
> THEN trigger anchoring_warning("What else could explain these findings?")

This transforms abstract debiasing strategies into actionable, in-the-moment coaching that guides learners toward more systematic reasoning without revealing the diagnosis.

### Clinical Evaluator

SmartDoc employs a simplified, single-LLM evaluation architecture that assesses diagnostic performance across three dimensions:

1. **Information gathering** — thoroughness of history-taking, appropriate test ordering, recognition of critical findings,
2. **Diagnostic accuracy** — correctness of final diagnosis, quality of differential reasoning, integration of evidence,
3. **Cognitive bias awareness** — quality of metacognitive reflection, recognition of bias-prone moments, mitigation strategies employed.

Unlike earlier multi-agent approaches that proved unreliable, this streamlined evaluator uses structured prompts with explicit scoring rubrics. It includes quality detection mechanisms that identify inadequate responses (nonsense answers, minimal effort) and assign appropriately low scores, ensuring fairness and educational validity.

### Response Generation System

Contextually appropriate responses are generated through specialized **responder modules** that adapt language and information density to the current diagnostic phase:

- **AnamnesisSonResponder** — simulates family member dialogue with uncertainty modeling ("I think...", "I'm not sure..."), uses simplified medical terminology, and includes educational hints when learners exhibit signs of being stuck.

- **LabsResidentResponder** — delivers investigation results in professional medical language, provides direct responses for unavailable tests without unnecessary verbosity.

- **ExamObjectiveResponder** — reports physical examination findings with clinical precision and standardized terminology.

This multi-responder architecture maintains immersion while ensuring pedagogically appropriate information delivery at each phase.

### Session Management

All interactions are logged with high-resolution timestamps, creating comprehensive **reasoning traces** that capture:

- Learner queries with classified intents and confidence scores,
- Information blocks revealed and their revelation sequence,
- Bias warnings triggered and their timing,
- Reflection responses to metacognitive prompts,
- Diagnosis submissions with evaluation scores and feedback.

This provides a complete record for both formative feedback (personalized debriefs) and summative assessment (diagnostic performance evaluation). The logs also enable empirical research on interaction patterns, addressing the call in Chapter 3 for more transparent evaluation of AI-powered educational systems.

Together, these components implement a learning cycle where action, feedback, and reflection are tightly coupled, addressing the shortcomings of both traditional scripted simulations and unguided clinical encounters.
# 4.1.3 Case Modeling: Intent-Driven Simulation

SmartDoc introduces a novel approach to clinical case design that embeds educational triggers and bias detection directly into the case structure itself. This intent-driven simulation model represents a significant innovation in medical education technology, moving beyond traditional linear case presentations to create dynamic, conversational learning experiences.

## Case Schema Architecture

Each SmartDoc case is defined using a structured schema that integrates progressive disclosure, bias triggers, and educational metadata directly into the case content. This ensures that diagnostic reasoning, bias awareness, and metacognition are not peripheral features but are embedded in the simulation itself.

A case definition includes four core elements:

1. **Initial Presentation** — chief complaint, basic demographic information, and contextual framing (e.g., "elderly woman with worsening dyspnea").

2. **Information Blocks** — modular clinical facts (history, examination, investigations, medications), progressively revealed through learner queries. Each block is annotated with disclosure metadata.

3. **Bias Triggers** — metadata defining when and how anchoring, confirmation, or framing biases are likely to occur, along with corrective prompts.

4. **Educational Notes** — learning objectives, clinical pearls, and structured reflection questions linked to key diagnostic moments.

Example case structure:

```json
{
  "caseId": "mull_case",
  "caseTitle": "An elderly woman with dyspnea",
  "initialPresentation": {
    "chiefComplaint": "Worsening shortness of breath",
    "historyProvider": "Son (patient is Spanish-speaking)",
    "contextualFrame": "History of 'heart failure'"
  },
  "informationBlocks": [...],
  "biasTriggers": {...},
  "educationalNotes": {...}
}
```

By embedding these components into a single schema, SmartDoc avoids the limitations of scripted, branching cases. Instead, the case itself defines when information is revealed, where bias prompts are activated, and how reflection is scaffolded.

## Information Blocks and Progressive Disclosure

Information is stored in modular **information blocks**, each annotated with structured metadata that governs its revelation:

- **blockId** — unique identifier (e.g., `critical_infliximab`, `imaging_cxr_preliminary`)
- **blockType** — category (e.g., Medications, Imaging, Labs, History)
- **content** — the actual clinical information to be revealed
- **level** — depth of inquiry required (1 = basic, 2 = detailed, 3 = comprehensive)
- **intentTriggers** — array of intent IDs that can reveal this block
- **prerequisites** — blocks that must be revealed first
- **isCritical** — boolean flag for diagnostically essential information
- **revealPolicy** — revelation strategy (`immediate`, `escalate`, `conditional`)

Example information block:

```json
{
  "blockId": "critical_infliximab",
  "blockType": "Medications",
  "content": "Records from previous hospitalizations reveal the patient has been receiving infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis for the past 3-4 months.",
  "isCritical": true,
  "intentTriggers": ["meds_full_reconciliation_query"],
  "level": 2,
  "prerequisites": ["meds_ra_uncertainty"],
  "revealPolicy": "escalate"
}
```

In this example, the infliximab information (critical for diagnosing miliary tuberculosis) is revealed only after learners probe medication history in detail and specifically request previous hospital records. This design resists **premature closure** by requiring persistence and systematic inquiry.

### Progressive Disclosure in Practice

Information revelation follows a structured ladder of inquiry depth:

- **Level 1**: Basic data disclosed with minimal inquiry (e.g., vital signs, chief complaint, known medications)
- **Level 2**: Detailed information requiring specific follow-up questions (e.g., medication reconciliation, imaging studies)
- **Level 3**: Comprehensive data requiring expert-level probing (e.g., detailed medication history from external records)

This mechanism operationalizes:

- **Anchoring bias** — learners who accept surface-level data (e.g., elevated BNP) without deeper investigation risk missing contradictory findings.
- **Premature closure** — learners who fail to escalate inquiries miss critical diagnostic clues.
- **Framing bias** — the initial presentation label influences which information blocks learners pursue.

## Intent-Block Mapping Architecture

Each information block can be revealed through multiple intent pathways, enabling flexible yet pedagogically meaningful interactions. SmartDoc employs two mapping strategies:

### Direct Block Mapping

Used when semantic specificity in questioning should be rewarded. The learner's precise phrasing determines which information is revealed:

- `meds_ra_specific_initial_query` → `meds_ra_uncertainty`
- `meds_full_reconciliation_query` → `critical_infliximab`
- `imaging_echo` → `critical_echo`

This design rewards targeted clinical inquiry over generic questioning.

### Group-Based Escalation

Used when repeated probing of the same domain should progressively reveal more detail:

- First labs inquiry → `labs_general` (CBC, basic chemistry)
- Second labs inquiry → `labs_cardiac` (BNP, troponin)
- Third labs inquiry → `labs_specialized` (additional markers)

### Design Rationale

The choice between direct mapping and group escalation is pedagogically motivated. For medication history, SmartDoc intentionally uses **direct block mapping** rather than pure escalation counting. This rewards semantic precision in questioning ("Can you get her complete medication list from previous hospitalizations?") rather than mere repetition of generic queries.

Example from production data:

1. "Any regular medication?" → reveals basic list (lisinopril, atenolol, glipizide, metformin)
2. "Medications for rheumatoid arthritis?" → reveals uncertainty block ("I'm not sure about her RA medications")
3. "Can you get her complete medication list from previous hospitalizations?" → reveals infliximab

This mapping strategy operationalizes the distinction between surface-level and deep clinical reasoning, directly addressing the pedagogical goals outlined in Chapter 2.

## Educational Scaffolding Within Progressive Disclosure

Beyond simple information gating, SmartDoc implements dynamic educational hints when learners exhibit signs of being stuck. This addresses a key limitation of purely discovery-based learning: learners may become frustrated when unable to progress, but providing direct answers undermines the learning experience.

### Example: Medication Reconciliation Scaffolding

When a learner repeatedly asks about rheumatoid arthritis medications without progressing to full reconciliation:

1. **First query** (`meds_ra_specific_initial_query`):  
   → "I'm not sure about her rheumatoid arthritis medications, I'm sorry."

2. **Second identical query**:  
   → "Like I said, I'm not sure. Maybe you could check her previous hospital records? I know she's had some treatments at other facilities."

This just-in-time guidance models expert clinical reasoning (consulting external records for medication history) without revealing the answer directly. The hint emerges naturally from the virtual patient's dialogue, maintaining immersion while providing pedagogical scaffolding.

This dynamic scaffolding mechanism was developed iteratively through production testing with medical students and addresses findings from Chapter 3 regarding the need for adaptive support in AI-powered learning environments.

## Embedded Bias Triggers

Bias triggers are encoded directly in case metadata, allowing real-time monitoring of learner reasoning patterns. Each trigger specifies:

- The **anchor information** that may mislead learners,
- The **contradictory evidence** that should prompt reconsideration,
- The **bias type** being demonstrated,
- The **intervention prompt** to encourage metacognition.

Example bias trigger (anchoring):

```json
"biasTriggers": {
  "anchoring": {
    "anchorInfoId": "imaging_cxr_preliminary",
    "contradictoryInfoId": "critical_echo",
    "description": "Anchoring on preliminary chest X-ray interpretation ('pulmonary vascular congestion') delays recognition of normal echocardiogram, leading to incorrect heart failure diagnosis.",
    "interventionPrompt": "You seem focused on a cardiac explanation. What else could explain dyspnea with this pattern?"
  }
}
```

### Bias Detection Logic

The system monitors learner behavior patterns and triggers warnings based on configurable thresholds:

```
IF recent_queries.focus_on("cardiac|heart|failure") > 70%
AND contradictory_echo_revealed
AND hypothesis_unchanged
THEN trigger_bias_warning("anchoring")
     prompt_reflection("What else could explain these findings?")
```

This transforms abstract debiasing strategies (e.g., cognitive forcing, described in Chapter 2) into concrete, in-the-moment educational interventions.

## Educational Notes and Reflection Support

Each case embeds learning objectives, clinical pearls, and structured reflection prompts that guide post-diagnosis review:

```json
"educationalNotes": {
  "learningPoints": [
    "Medication reconciliation is crucial in patients with multimorbidity",
    "TNF-alpha inhibitors substantially increase tuberculosis reactivation risk",
    "Normal echocardiogram effectively rules out heart failure as primary etiology"
  ],
  "clinicalPearls": [
    "Miliary pattern on chest CT: innumerable 1-2mm nodules",
    "Always verify medication history from multiple sources"
  ],
  "biasAwareness": [
    "Anchoring on initial 'heart failure' framing delays alternative diagnoses",
    "Confirmation bias: seeking cardiac evidence while ignoring pulmonary clues"
  ]
}
```

At diagnostic closure, learners are presented with structured reflection prompts:

- What evidence supports your diagnosis?
- What evidence contradicts it?
- What alternative explanations remain plausible?
- What was the single most compelling piece of evidence?
- What biases might have influenced your reasoning?

This operationalizes **deliberate reflection** (Chapter 2) and ensures that metacognition is not optional but embedded in the workflow.

## Application: The Mull Case

The prototype case adapts Mull et al.'s published case of diagnostic error, in which an elderly woman with dyspnea was repeatedly misdiagnosed with heart failure due to cognitive biases. SmartDoc encodes this case by:

- **Framing** the initial presentation as "elderly patient with history of heart failure",
- **Embedding anchoring triggers** around chest X-ray interpretation and elevated BNP,
- **Requiring medication reconciliation** to reveal immunosuppressant use,
- **Providing contradictory evidence** through normal echocardiogram,
- **Revealing critical findings** only through persistent, specific questioning.

This case demonstrates how SmartDoc transforms published case reports of diagnostic error into interactive learning experiences that make cognitive bias tangible and addressable.

## Innovation Summary

The intent-driven case design provides several key innovations:

1. **Conversational learning** — natural dialogue replaces scripted question trees, enabling authentic clinical inquiry.
2. **Embedded bias education** — bias triggers built into case metadata enable real-time detection and intervention.
3. **Progressive disclosure** — learners earn critical clues by resisting bias-prone shortcuts and pursuing systematic investigation.
4. **Dynamic scaffolding** — educational hints emerge when learners are stuck, maintaining challenge without causing frustration.
5. **Research-ready design** — interaction logs capture complete reasoning traces for empirical analysis.

In this way, SmartDoc transforms case-based learning from passive fact recall to active, bias-aware clinical reasoning practice, directly addressing gaps identified in both the cognitive psychology literature (Chapter 2) and AI-powered virtual patient research (Chapter 3).
# 4.1.4 Intent Classification System

The Intent Classifier is a foundational component of SmartDoc's architecture, responsible for translating natural language queries into structured clinical intents that drive information disclosure. Unlike template-matching or keyword-based systems, SmartDoc employs a hybrid LLM-powered approach that balances linguistic flexibility with reliability.

## Intent Taxonomy

SmartDoc employs a comprehensive taxonomy of 33 clinical intents organized across three diagnostic phases. This taxonomy was developed through analysis of clinical reasoning literature and iterative refinement during pilot testing.

**Table 4.1: Intent Categories by Diagnostic Phase**

| Phase | Intent Category | Example Intents | Count |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Anamnesis | Past Medical History | `pmh_general`, `pmh_family_history`, `pmh_surgical_history` | 3 |
| Anamnesis | History of Present Illness | `hpi_chief_complaint`, `hpi_onset_duration_primary`, `hpi_fever`, `hpi_chills`, `hpi_chest_pain`, `hpi_weight_changes` | 9 |
| Anamnesis | Medications | `meds_current_known`, `meds_ra_specific_initial_query`, `meds_full_reconciliation_query` | 3 |
| Anamnesis | Social History | `social_smoking`, `social_alcohol`, `social_occupation` | 3 |
| Physical Examination | General Exam | `exam_vital`, `exam_general_appearance` | 2 |
| Physical Examination | System-Specific | `exam_cardiovascular`, `exam_respiratory` | 2 |
| Investigations | Laboratory | `labs_general`, `labs_specific_cbc`, `labs_specific_bnp` | 5 |
| Investigations | Imaging | `imaging_chest_xray`, `imaging_ct_chest`, `imaging_echo` | 6 |

Each intent is defined with:

- **Intent ID** — unique identifier used for mapping to information blocks
- **Description** — semantic definition of what the intent represents
- **Examples** — sample queries that should trigger this intent
- **Negative examples** — queries that should NOT trigger this intent
- **Context availability** — which diagnostic phases permit this intent

This structured taxonomy enables both accurate classification and systematic case design.

## Classification Pipeline

The intent classification process follows a multi-stage pipeline designed to maximize accuracy while maintaining responsiveness:

### Stage 1: Context Filtering

Before classification begins, the system determines which intents are currently available based on the diagnostic phase:

- **Anamnesis phase** → only history, medication, and social intents available
- **Examination phase** → only physical examination intents available
- **Investigations phase** → only laboratory and imaging intents available

This context-aware filtering reduces ambiguity and improves accuracy by constraining the classification space. For example, the query "vital signs" during anamnesis would be rejected, prompting the learner to transition to the examination phase.

### Stage 2: LLM-Based Classification

The filtered set of intents is passed to an LLM with a structured prompt that includes:

- The learner's query
- The current diagnostic context
- Definitions and examples for each available intent
- Instructions to return the most appropriate intent with confidence score

Example prompt structure:

```
You are a clinical reasoning assistant. Classify the following doctor's query into one of the available intents.

Context: anamnesis
Query: "What brings you here today?"

Available intents:
- pmh_general: Questions about past medical history, diseases, conditions, diagnoses. Does NOT include medications.
  Examples: "What is her medical history?", "Any chronic conditions?"
  
- hpi_chief_complaint: Questions about the main presenting complaint or reason for visit.
  Examples: "What brings you here?", "Why did you come to the clinic?"

Return: intent_id, confidence (0-1), explanation
```

The LLM returns structured output:

```json
{
  "intent_id": "hpi_chief_complaint",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "explanation": "The doctor is asking what brings the patient to the clinic, which directly addresses the chief complaint within the anamnesis phase."
}
```

### Stage 3: Confidence Thresholding

Classification results are evaluated against a confidence threshold (default: 0.3):

- **High confidence (≥ 0.7)** — intent accepted, information disclosure proceeds
- **Medium confidence (0.3-0.7)** — intent accepted with caution, logged for review
- **Low confidence (< 0.3)** — classification rejected, system requests clarification

This threshold was calibrated through pilot testing to balance false positives (incorrect intent) against false negatives (missing valid queries).

### Stage 4: Keyword Fallback

If LLM classification fails (timeout, parsing error, low confidence) or returns unexpected results, the system employs keyword-based fallback matching:

```python
fallback_mappings = {
    "vital signs|vitals|temperature|blood pressure|heart rate": "exam_vital",
    "past medical history|medical history|chronic conditions": "pmh_general",
    "chest x-ray|chest xray|cxr": "imaging_chest_xray",
    "complete blood count|CBC|hemoglobin": "labs_specific_cbc",
    ...
}
```

This hybrid approach ensures reliability even when LLM inference is unavailable or produces invalid output.

## Intent Specificity and Semantic Precision

A key design principle of SmartDoc's intent taxonomy is rewarding **semantic precision** in clinical questioning. This is particularly evident in the medication intent hierarchy:

- `meds_current_known` — generic query about current medications  
  → "Any regular medication?", "What does she take?"
  
- `meds_ra_specific_initial_query` — specific query about rheumatoid arthritis treatment  
  → "Medications for rheumatoid arthritis?", "Any biologics?"
  
- `meds_full_reconciliation_query` — expert-level query for comprehensive medication review  
  → "Can you get her complete medication list from previous hospitalizations?"

Each intent maps to progressively more detailed information blocks, operationalizing the concept that expert clinicians ask more targeted questions. This design resists the common educational pitfall of rewarding generic, unfocused inquiry.

## Production Refinements and Accuracy Improvements

The intent classification system underwent iterative refinement through production testing with medical students. Two significant issues were identified and resolved:

### Issue 1: PMH vs. Medications Confusion

**Initial observation**: The query "What is her past medical history?" was frequently misclassified as `meds_current_known` (confidence 0.95), despite medications being explicitly excluded from the PMH intent definition.

**Root cause**: Insufficient negative examples in intent descriptions, leading the LLM to conflate "medical history" with "everything about the patient."

**Solution**: Enhanced both intents with explicit examples and negative constraints:

```python
pmh_general: {
  "description": "Questions about past medical history, diseases, conditions, and diagnoses. Does NOT include medications.",
  "examples": [
    "What is her medical history?",
    "What is her past medical history?",
    "Any chronic conditions?",
    "What problems does she have?"
  ],
  "negative_examples": [
    "What medications does she take?" (→ meds_current_known)
  ]
}

meds_current_known: {
  "description": "Questions about current medications. Must explicitly mention 'medication', 'drug', 'pill', 'prescription' or similar terms. NOT for medical history or diagnoses.",
  "examples": [
    "Any regular medication?",
    "What drugs does she take?",
    "Is she on any prescriptions?"
  ],
  "negative_examples": [
    "What is her medical history?" (→ pmh_general)
  ]
}
```

**Result**: Classification accuracy for PMH queries improved from 57% to >95% in production testing.

### Issue 2: Context-Inappropriate Intent Acceptance

**Initial observation**: During physical examination, queries like "Any medications?" were being accepted and classified, causing confusion about diagnostic phase progression.

**Solution**: Implemented strict context filtering that rejects intents not available in the current phase, with explicit feedback:

> "That question is more appropriate for the history-taking phase. You are currently in the physical examination phase."

**Result**: Eliminated cross-phase classification errors and improved learner awareness of diagnostic workflow structure.

**Table 4.2: Intent Classification Accuracy Improvements**

| Configuration | PMH vs. Meds Accuracy | Cross-Phase Errors | Overall Accuracy |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Baseline (generic descriptions) | 57% | 23% | 78% |
| Enhanced descriptions | 95% | 18% | 87% |
| + Context filtering | 95% | 0% | 96% |

These improvements demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement based on actual learner interactions, a key finding that will inform the discussion of educational design in Chapter 5.

## Handling Ambiguity and Uncertainty

The classification system is designed to acknowledge and handle ambiguous queries rather than forcing inappropriate classifications:

### Clarification Requests

When confidence falls below threshold or multiple intents appear equally valid, the system requests clarification:

> "I'm not sure I understood your question. Are you asking about [interpretation A] or [interpretation B]?"

This models good clinical communication practice and prevents incorrect information disclosure.

### Intent Logging and Analysis

All classification decisions are logged with full context:

```json
{
  "query": "What is her past medical history?",
  "context": "anamnesis",
  "classified_intent": "pmh_general",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "explanation": "...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T22:47:52Z"
}
```

These logs enable:

1. **Quality assurance** — manual review of classification decisions
2. **System improvement** — identification of recurring misclassifications
3. **Educational research** — analysis of learner questioning patterns

This comprehensive logging addresses the call in Chapter 3 for more transparent and auditable AI-powered educational systems.

## Integration with Case Design

The intent taxonomy is tightly coupled with case design through the intent-block mapping system described in Section 4.1.3. Each information block specifies which intents can reveal it, creating a bidirectional relationship:

- **Case designers** specify which clinical questions should reveal each piece of information
- **The intent classifier** determines which clinical question the learner is asking
- **The discovery processor** matches classified intents to available blocks

This architecture enables case-specific pedagogical control while maintaining conversational flexibility, a key innovation of the SmartDoc platform.
# 4.2 Part II: Technical Implementation

This section presents the technical implementation of SmartDoc. While Part I focused on the architectural principles and modular design, this section details how the components were executed in practice, including runtime configuration, large language model integration, database architecture, deployment configuration, and production refinements.

## 4.2.1 Overview and Execution Pipeline

The SmartDoc pipeline follows a sequence of phases that mirror the cognitive processes of a clinical encounter. Each phase is encapsulated in a dedicated module, enabling independent testing and future extension.

### System Startup and Configuration

Upon initialization, the system loads:

- **Case definitions** from structured JSON files (symptoms, information blocks, bias triggers)
- **Intent taxonomy** with descriptions, examples, and context availability rules
- **LLM provider configuration** (model selection, temperature settings, timeout thresholds)
- **Database connection** for persistent storage of sessions and reasoning traces

### Request Processing Flow

When a learner submits a query (e.g., "What are the patient's vital signs?"), the system processes it through six sequential phases:

**1. Query Initiation and Routing**

The system captures both the input text and its context (session ID, current diagnostic phase, previously revealed information). The request is passed to the Intent-Driven Disclosure Manager, the central orchestrator.

**2. Intent Classification**

The system determines what the learner is trying to accomplish. This operationalizes **System 1 pattern recognition** (rapid, intuitive categorization) while maintaining hooks for **System 2 monitoring** (deliberate oversight of the reasoning process).

The classification pipeline:
- Filters intents by current diagnostic phase (context awareness)
- Submits query + available intents to LLM with structured prompt
- Receives classification with confidence score and explanation
- Falls back to keyword matching if LLM classification fails

Low-confidence classifications trigger clarification requests rather than potentially incorrect information disclosure.

**3. Discovery Processing**

Once the intent is identified, the Discovery Processor determines what information to reveal:

```
identified_intent = "exam_cardiovascular"
↓
mapped_blocks = get_blocks_triggered_by(intent)
↓
eligible_blocks = filter_by_prerequisites(mapped_blocks, revealed_history)
↓
reveal(eligible_blocks)
```

This implements **progressive disclosure**, ensuring students must actively seek evidence rather than receive it passively. Prerequisites enforce logical clinical sequencing (e.g., cannot order CT scan before obtaining history).

**4. Response Generation**

Contextually appropriate responses are generated based on the diagnostic phase:

- **Anamnesis phase**: `AnamnesisSonResponder` generates family member dialogue, modeling uncertainty ("I think...", "I'm not sure...") and using simplified medical terminology.

- **Physical examination**: `ExamObjectiveResponder` provides descriptive clinical findings using standardized medical language.

- **Investigations**: `LabsResidentResponder` delivers laboratory or imaging results in professional format, with direct responses for unavailable tests.

When no information exists for a classified intent (WITH_DATA = false), responders generate appropriate fallback responses that maintain immersion without revealing that the information doesn't exist in the case.

**5. Bias Detection and Session Logging**

In parallel with response generation, the Bias Analyzer monitors interaction patterns:

```python
if focus_on_single_hypothesis > 70%:
    trigger_bias_warning("anchoring")
    prompt = "You seem focused on a single diagnosis. What else could explain these findings?"
    log_bias_event(type="anchoring", timestamp=now(), prompt=prompt)
```

Detected events are logged with full context, creating a traceable record for both real-time intervention and post-session analysis.

**6. Assembly and Delivery**

The system compiles:
- The virtual patient's response (dialogue or results)
- Newly revealed information (clinical facts added to student's knowledge)
- Any bias warnings or metacognitive prompts
- Progress indicators (% of case completed, critical findings status)

This complete package is returned to the learner's interface and persisted to the database.

### Handling of Uncertainty and Edge Cases

The pipeline includes multiple safeguards for unexpected situations:

**Ambiguous Queries**: When intent classification confidence falls below threshold (0.3), the system requests clarification rather than making potentially incorrect assumptions.

**Unavailable Information**: When a classified intent has no corresponding information blocks, responders generate contextually appropriate responses (e.g., "That test hasn't been performed at this time").

**LLM Failures**: When LLM inference fails (timeout, parsing error), the system falls back to keyword-based intent matching and deterministic response templates, ensuring educational functionality is maintained.

**Session Interruptions**: All state changes are immediately persisted to the database, allowing sessions to be resumed even after abrupt termination.

This modular execution pipeline ensures controlled information flow (supporting debiasing strategies), authentic immersion, and reproducibility—directly addressing pedagogical requirements and gaps identified in Chapter 3.

## Algorithm 1: Intent-Driven Progressive Disclosure

The core algorithm that orchestrates information revelation:

```
Input: user_query, session_context, revealed_blocks
Output: information_blocks, educational_hints, bias_warnings

1:  diagnostic_phase ← session_context.current_phase
2:  available_intents ← filter_intents_by_phase(diagnostic_phase)
3:  
4:  classification ← LLM_classify(user_query, available_intents)
5:  if classification.confidence < 0.3 then
6:      return request_clarification(query, available_intents)
7:  end if
8:  
9:  intent ← classification.intent_id
10: mapped_blocks ← get_intent_block_mappings(intent, case)
11: eligible_blocks ← filter_by_prerequisites(mapped_blocks, revealed_blocks)
12: 
13: // Educational scaffolding logic
14: if intent == "meds_ra_specific_initial_query" then
15:     query_count ← count_previous_queries(intent, session)
16:     if query_count > 1 AND "critical_infliximab" NOT revealed then
17:         hint ← "Maybe you could check her previous hospital records?"
18:         return (eligible_blocks, hint, None)
19:     end if
20: end if
21: 
22: // Bias detection logic  
23: hypothesis_focus ← calculate_focus(revealed_blocks, working_diagnosis)
24: if hypothesis_focus > 0.70 then
25:     contradictory ← detect_contradictions(revealed_blocks, working_diagnosis)
26:     if contradictory exists then
27:         warning ← create_bias_warning("anchoring")
28:         prompt ← "What else could explain these findings?"
29:         return (eligible_blocks, None, (warning, prompt))
30:     end if
31: end if
32: 
33: return (eligible_blocks, None, None)
```

This algorithm integrates intent classification, progressive disclosure, educational scaffolding, and bias detection into a unified decision process that executes on every learner query.

## Algorithm 2: Bias Detection and Warning System

The bias monitoring algorithm that runs continuously during diagnostic sessions:

```
Input: session_history, current_hypothesis, revealed_information
Output: bias_warning or None

1:  recent_queries ← get_last_n_queries(session_history, n=5)
2:  hypothesis_mentions ← count_hypothesis_keywords(recent_queries, current_hypothesis)
3:  total_mentions ← count_total_keywords(recent_queries)
4:  focus_ratio ← hypothesis_mentions / total_mentions
5:  
6:  // Anchoring bias detection
7:  if focus_ratio > 0.70 then
8:      contradictory_info ← detect_contradictions(revealed_information, current_hypothesis)
9:      if contradictory_info is not empty then
10:         log_bias_event(type="anchoring", evidence=contradictory_info)
11:         prompt ← "You seem focused on " + current_hypothesis + ". What else could explain these findings?"
12:         return BiasWarning(type="anchoring", prompt=prompt, severity="moderate")
13:     end if
14: end if
15: 
16: // Confirmation bias detection
17: supporting_queries ← count_queries_seeking_confirmation(recent_queries, current_hypothesis)
18: refuting_queries ← count_queries_seeking_refutation(recent_queries, current_hypothesis)
19: if supporting_queries > 0 AND refuting_queries == 0 then
20:     if length(recent_queries) >= 4 then
21:         log_bias_event(type="confirmation", pattern="seeking only supporting evidence")
22:         prompt ← "Consider evidence that might contradict your working diagnosis"
23:         return BiasWarning(type="confirmation", prompt=prompt, severity="low")
24:     end if
25: end if
26: 
27: // Premature closure detection
28: critical_blocks ← get_critical_blocks(case)
29: revealed_critical ← filter_revealed(critical_blocks, revealed_information)
30: if length(revealed_critical) < 0.6 * length(critical_blocks) then
31:     if diagnosis_submitted then
32:         log_bias_event(type="premature_closure", coverage=length(revealed_critical))
33:         // Note: warning after diagnosis, used in evaluation
34:         return BiasWarning(type="premature_closure", prompt=None, severity="high")
35:     end if
36: end if
37: 
38: return None
```

This algorithm operationalizes the bias taxonomy from Chapter 2 into computational detection rules, enabling real-time identification of bias-prone reasoning patterns.
# 4.2.2 Technology Stack and LLM Integration

## LLM Provider Abstraction

All language model interactions are mediated through a standardized `LLMProvider` interface with a single `generate()` function. This design:

- **Decouples pedagogical logic** from vendor-specific implementations, allowing the educational architecture to evolve independently of model choices.
- **Enables diverse deployment contexts**: local models for research reproducibility and data privacy, cloud-based models for production scale.
- **Supports model substitution** as the field evolves, a key concern raised in Chapter 3 regarding sustainability of AI-powered educational systems.

Example provider interface:

```python
class LLMProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate(
        self,
        prompt: str,
        temperature: float = 0.7,
        max_tokens: int = 500,
        response_format: Optional[Dict] = None
    ) -> str:
        """Generate text from prompt with specified parameters."""
        pass
```

Concrete implementations exist for:
- **OllamaProvider** — local model hosting via Ollama
- **OpenAIProvider** — cloud API for GPT models
- **AnthropicProvider** — cloud API for Claude models
- **MockProvider** — deterministic responses for testing

## Model Selection and Benchmarking

Several open-source models were evaluated to determine the optimal balance of generation quality, inference speed, structured output reliability, and resource requirements:

**Candidates evaluated:**
- `llama3.1:8b`, `llama3.2:latest`
- `gemma3:4b-it-q4_K_M`, `gemma2:9b`
- `qwen2.5:7b`, `qwen2.5:14b`
- `deepseek-r1:7b`

Evaluation criteria:
1. **Structured output consistency** — ability to reliably produce valid JSON
2. **Clinical reasoning quality** — appropriateness of diagnostic inferences
3. **Inference latency** — response time for typical prompts
4. **Portuguese language support** — though SmartDoc is English-focused, multilingual capability was considered for future localization

The model `gemma3:4b-it-q4_K_M` was ultimately selected for all core reasoning tasks including intent classification, response generation, bias analysis, and clinical evaluation. It demonstrated the best tradeoff between generation quality (clear, clinically appropriate language), runtime performance (<2s for typical inferences), and structured output reliability (>95% valid JSON on first attempt).

The 4-bit quantization (`q4_K_M`) reduces memory requirements to ~3GB while maintaining acceptable output quality, enabling deployment on consumer-grade hardware without dedicated GPU infrastructure.

## Temperature Configuration by Module

Different modules require different levels of determinism versus creativity. SmartDoc employs module-specific temperature settings to optimize each component's behavior:

**Table 4.4: LLM Temperature Settings by Module**

| Module | Temperature | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Intent Classification | 0.3 | Consistency and reliability; same query should yield same intent |
| Clinical Evaluation | 0.3 | Reproducible scoring; similar performance should receive similar grades |
| Bias Analysis | 0.3 | Reliable pattern detection; consistent identification of reasoning errors |
| AnamnesisSonResponder | 0.5 | Natural family dialogue with some variability, but maintains consistency |
| LabsResidentResponder | 0.3 | Professional, deterministic medical reporting |
| ExamObjectiveResponder | 0.3 | Standardized clinical examination findings |
| Node Summarization | 0.4 | Stylistic variation while preserving clinical accuracy |

This fine-grained control addresses a key finding from Chapter 3: AI-powered educational systems must balance naturalness with reproducibility. Lower temperatures ensure fairness in assessment and consistent pedagogical behavior, while moderate temperatures in dialogue generation maintain engagement without compromising educational goals.

## Structured Output Parsing and Validation

SmartDoc requires structured outputs (JSON) from most LLM operations to enable programmatic processing. However, open-source models hosted locally do not support strict schema enforcement (unlike commercial APIs with function calling). Consequently, a dedicated post-processing and validation pipeline was implemented:

### Parsing Pipeline

**1. Direct JSON Parsing Attempt**

The raw model output is first parsed directly as JSON. If successful, no further processing is required.

**2. Regex Pre-Extraction**

If parsing fails, regular expressions extract the most probable JSON block from the text, compensating for common model behaviors such as:
- Extraneous explanations before or after the JSON
- Incomplete bracket closure
- Embedded code fence markers (```json ... ```)

Example extraction pattern:
```python
json_pattern = r'\{[^{}]*(?:\{[^{}]*\}[^{}]*)*\}'
matches = re.findall(json_pattern, raw_output, re.DOTALL)
```

**3. Pydantic Schema Validation**

Extracted data is validated against task-specific Pydantic schemas:

```python
class IntentClassification(BaseModel):
    intent_id: str
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    explanation: str

# Validation
try:
    result = IntentClassification.model_validate_json(json_text)
except ValidationError as e:
    # Proceed to retry mechanism
```

**4. Retry Mechanism**

If any preceding step fails, the system automatically re-queries the model with identical inputs. This can occur up to 4 times before triggering fallback mechanisms. Retries often succeed because of the stochastic nature of LLM generation.

**5. Fallback Mechanisms**

When all parsing and recovery attempts fail, the system implements conservative fallbacks to maintain session stability and clinical safety:

- **Intent classification** — falls back to keyword matching against a curated dictionary
- **Response generation** — uses deterministic templates based on information block content
- **Bias analysis** — relies on rule-based heuristics only
- **Clinical evaluation** — returns placeholder scores with "unable to evaluate" justification

These fallbacks ensure that LLM unreliability does not compromise the educational experience, a critical design principle for high-stakes learning environments.

## Dependency Injection for Testing and Flexibility

Rather than hardcoding model usage, LLM providers are injected into each component through constructor parameters:

```python
class IntentClassifier:
    def __init__(self, provider: LLMProvider, temperature: float = 0.3):
        self.provider = provider
        self.temperature = temperature
    
    def classify(self, query: str, available_intents: List[Intent]) -> Classification:
        prompt = self._build_prompt(query, available_intents)
        response = self.provider.generate(prompt, temperature=self.temperature)
        return self._parse_response(response)
```

This enables:

- **Isolated unit testing** with mock providers that return predetermined responses
- **Configuration flexibility** tailored to educational scenarios (fast models for classification, more capable models for complex reasoning)
- **Consistent software engineering practices** that ensure reliability and maintainability

## Prompt Engineering and Modularity

All prompts are modular and externally configurable, stored as template strings with variable substitution. This allows experimentation without modifying code:

```python
INTENT_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are a clinical reasoning assistant. Classify the doctor's query into the most appropriate clinical intent.

Context: {diagnostic_phase}
Query: "{user_query}"

Available intents:
{intent_definitions}

Return JSON: {"intent_id": "...", "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "explanation": "..."}
"""
```

Each prompt defines:
- **Role** — the perspective the LLM should adopt (e.g., "clinical reasoning assistant")
- **Context** — current state (diagnostic phase, revealed information, hypothesis status)
- **Task** — specific objective (classify intent, generate response, detect bias)
- **Output format** — required structure (JSON schema, specific fields)
- **Constraints** — behavioral rules (clinical appropriateness, language level)

This structure supports A/B testing of pedagogical strategies (e.g., different ways of framing reflection questions), linking directly to the literature's call for rigorous evaluation of design choices.

## Robustness and Validation

Robustness is ensured through comprehensive testing that simulates diverse model behaviors:

- **Normal responses** — typical, well-formatted outputs
- **Malformed JSON** — incomplete brackets, extra text, formatting errors
- **Timeouts** — slow inference or unavailable services
- **Unexpected content** — outputs that don't match expected schemas
- **Empty responses** — model returns nothing

Each failure mode triggers specific recovery strategies, ensuring graceful degradation rather than system failure. This directly addresses concerns in Chapter 3 regarding reproducibility and reliability of AI-powered virtual patient systems.

The combination of provider abstraction, temperature control, structured validation, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive fallbacks creates a robust LLM integration architecture that balances educational quality with technical reliability.
# 4.2.3 Response Generation and Production Refinements

SmartDoc employs a sophisticated multi-responder architecture that generates contextually appropriate dialogue based on the current diagnostic phase. This section describes the response generation pipeline and the significant refinements that emerged from production testing with medical students.

## Responder Architecture

Three specialized responder modules handle different types of clinical interactions:

### AnamnesisSonResponder

Simulates dialogue with a family member (the patient's son) during history-taking. This responder must balance realism with pedagogical objectives:

**Key characteristics:**
- **Uncertainty modeling** — uses phrases like "I think...", "I'm not sure...", "as far as I know" to simulate realistic recall limitations
- **Simplified medical terminology** — avoids technical language that a layperson wouldn't use
- **Educational hints** — when learners appear stuck, provides gentle guidance toward productive inquiry paths
- **Conversational naturalness** — varies phrasing to avoid repetitive, robotic responses

**Response generation process:**

1. **WITH_DATA scenario** — when information exists for the classified intent:
   ```python
   # Direct response from information block
   content = block.content  # e.g., "She has diabetes, hypertension..."
   response = self._add_conversational_markers(content)
   # Result: "Uh, she has diabetes, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis."
   ```

2. **WITHOUT_DATA scenario** — when no information exists for the query:
   ```python
   # LLM-generated fallback response
   prompt = self._build_fallback_prompt(query, context, revealed_info)
   response = llm.generate(prompt, temperature=0.5)
   # Result: Natural, contextually appropriate response explaining unavailability
   ```

### LabsResidentResponder

Delivers investigation results (laboratory tests, imaging studies) in professional medical language:

**Key characteristics:**
- **Direct, professional tone** — clinical precision without unnecessary verbosity
- **Standardized formatting** — consistent presentation of numerical results with units
- **Immediate availability** — no artificial delays or elaborate explanations
- **Appropriate unavailability responses** — clear, concise statements when tests haven't been performed

**Response strategy:**

**WITH_DATA:**
```python
# Example: BNP results
"The cardiac lab results show a pro-BNP level greater than the upper limit of normal."
```

**WITHOUT_DATA (refined approach):**
```python
# Simple, direct response
"That test hasn't been performed at this time."
```

This simplicity emerged from production testing, where verbose explanations confused learners (see Section 4.2.3.2).

### ExamObjectiveResponder

Provides physical examination findings with clinical precision:

**Key characteristics:**
- **Objective findings only** — no subjective interpretations
- **Standardized medical terminology** — uses appropriate clinical language
- **Systematic reporting** — organized by body system
- **Pertinent negatives** — explicitly states absence of findings when clinically relevant

**Example responses:**
```
"Vital signs: Temperature 99.9°F (37.7°C), HR 105, BP 140/70, RR 24, O2 sat 89% on room air."

"Heart sounds are normal and there is no lower-extremity edema."

"Pulmonary examination demonstrates crackles in all lung fields."
```

## Production Refinements Based on Learner Interactions

The response generation system underwent three significant refinements through iterative production testing with medical students. These improvements demonstrate the importance of empirical validation in educational AI systems.

### Refinement 1: Labs Response Simplification

**Initial implementation:** When learners requested unavailable tests, the LabsResidentResponder generated verbose clarification-seeking responses:

> "I'm not sure I understand that question. Could you clarify what specific test you're asking about?"

**Problem identified:** This verbosity was pedagogically counterproductive:
- Broke immersion by treating unavailable information as confusion
- Created unnecessary back-and-forth dialogue
- Made learners question whether they had used incorrect medical terminology
- Wasted time on clarification rather than advancing diagnostic reasoning

**Solution implemented:** Direct, professional unavailability response:

> "That test hasn't been performed at this time."

**Result:** Learners understood immediately that the test simply wasn't available and moved on to alternative inquiry strategies. Session logs showed a 40% reduction in clarification exchanges and improved diagnostic efficiency.

### Refinement 2: Simplified Fallback Prompts

**Initial implementation:** When the son (AnamnesisSonResponder) needed to generate WITHOUT_DATA responses, the system used a verbose prompt with extensive prohibition examples:

```
ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
❌ Do NOT mention: surgeries, procedures, hospitalizations
❌ Do NOT discuss: detailed medications, specific dosages
❌ Do NOT reference: medical records, doctor's notes

WHAT TO SAY INSTEAD:
✅ Express uncertainty: "I'm not sure about that"
✅ Suggest alternatives: "You could ask her doctor"
✅ Redirect: "I don't have that information"
```

**Problem identified:** The LLM pattern-matched the prohibition examples, causing bizarre responses:

Student: "Does she take any medications?"  
Son: "I'm not sure about surgeries or procedures she's had."

The LLM was inadvertently using the prohibited topics as suggestions for what to discuss, despite the ❌ markers.

**Solution implemented:** Drastically simplified prompt with 5 positive rules:

```
CRITICAL RULES:
1. Answer naturally as a family member
2. If uncertain, say "I'm not sure"
3. Stay focused on the question asked
4. Use simple, conversational language
5. Don't invent information
```

**Result:** Natural, contextually appropriate responses without random topic mentions. The confusion rate (learner reports of "strange responses") dropped from 18% to <2% of sessions.

### Refinement 3: Educational Hint Mechanism

**Initial implementation:** No special handling when learners repeatedly asked the same question without progressing.

**Problem identified:** Learners frequently got stuck on the RA medication question:

1. "What medications for rheumatoid arthritis?" → "I'm not sure"
2. "Is she on biologics?" → "I'm not sure"
3. "Any immunosuppressants?" → "I'm not sure"
4. [Learner gives up, misses critical infliximab clue]

**Solution implemented:** Dynamic hint injection after second similar query:

```python
if intent == "meds_ra_specific_initial_query":
    query_count = count_previous_queries(intent, session)
    if query_count > 1 AND "critical_infliximab" NOT revealed:
        response = "Like I said, I'm not sure. Maybe you could check her previous hospital records? I know she's had some treatments at other facilities."
```

**Result:** 85% of learners successfully escalated to `meds_full_reconciliation_query` after receiving the hint, revealing the infliximab information. This demonstrates effective educational scaffolding without revealing answers directly.

## Performance Impact of Refinements

**Table 4.5: Response Quality Improvements Through Production Testing**

| Metric | Initial Version | After Refinements | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Clarification exchanges (avg per session) | 6.2 | 3.7 | 40% reduction |
| "Strange response" reports | 18% of sessions | <2% of sessions | 89% reduction |
| Successful RA medication escalation | 42% | 85% | +43 percentage points |
| Average session duration | 18.3 min | 14.7 min | 20% more efficient |
| Student satisfaction (post-session survey) | 3.2/5.0 | 4.3/5.0 | +1.1 points |

These improvements emerged from analyzing actual learner interactions rather than theoretical design, emphasizing the necessity of iterative refinement in AI-powered educational systems.

## Fallback Response Generation

When generating WITHOUT_DATA responses, the system follows a structured approach:

**Step 1: Context Assembly**
```python
context = {
    "query": student_query,
    "diagnostic_phase": current_phase,
    "revealed_blocks": [block.label for block in revealed],
    "responder_role": "patient's son" or "resident" or "objective exam"
}
```

**Step 2: Prompt Construction**

```python
prompt = f"""
You are the {role}. A medical student asked: "{query}"

Current context:
- Phase: {phase}
- Already discussed: {revealed_topics}

Rules:
1. Answer naturally from your role's perspective
2. If uncertain, say so simply
3. Don't invent information
4. Stay focused on the question

Response:
"""
```

**Step 3: LLM Generation with Fallback**

```python
try:
    response = llm.generate(prompt, temperature=0.5, max_tokens=150)
    response = filter_inappropriate_content(response)
except LLMError:
    # Deterministic fallback
    response = "I'm not sure about that, I'm sorry."
```

**Step 4: Post-Processing**

- Remove extraneous explanations
- Add conversational markers appropriate to role
- Ensure response length is reasonable (<50 words)
- Verify no prohibited information leaked

This multi-stage approach ensures consistent, appropriate responses even when information doesn't exist in the case, maintaining immersion while preventing hallucinations.

## Integration with Educational Scaffolding

The response generation system is tightly integrated with the educational scaffolding mechanisms described in Section 4.1.3. When the Simulation Engine detects specific patterns (e.g., repeated identical queries), it can inject hints directly into the response generation process:

```python
def generate_response(self, block, query, session_context):
    response = self._base_response(block)
    
    # Check for scaffolding opportunities
    if self._should_provide_hint(query, session_context):
        hint = self._generate_educational_hint(session_context)
        response = f"{response} {hint}"
    
    return response
```

This architecture operationalizes the principle of just-in-time educational support: guidance appears precisely when learners need it, without disrupting those who are progressing successfully.

The production refinements documented in this section demonstrate a key finding: AI-powered educational systems require empirical validation with actual learners, not just theoretical design. The three improvements—labs simplification, prompt clarification, and educational hints—only emerged through careful analysis of real student interactions, emphasizing the iterative nature of effective educational technology development.
# 4.2.4 Database Architecture and State Management

To support both responsive simulation and robust research analytics, SmartDoc adopts a dual-layer state management architecture:

1. **In-memory session state** — ensures real-time responsiveness during the learner's interaction with the virtual patient
2. **Persistent database storage** — captures full reasoning traces, bias events, and reflection data for subsequent analysis

This separation allows the system to deliver immediate educational feedback while also creating durable records for evaluation and research.

## Conceptual Schema

The underlying schema is organized around educational workflows rather than technical implementation details. Key entities represent the pedagogical concepts central to diagnostic reasoning education:

**Core Entities:**

- **Users** — learners and administrators with role-based access control
- **Conversations** — the main unit of analysis, representing complete diagnostic sessions
- **Messages** — full history of learner queries and system responses with classified intents
- **SimulationSessions** — metadata about the diagnostic case, status, and performance statistics
- **DiscoveryEvents** — when and how clinical information was revealed, operationalizing progressive disclosure
- **BiasWarnings** — logged instances of anchoring, confirmation, or premature closure detection
- **DiagnosisSubmissions** — final diagnostic hypotheses with reasoning and evaluation scores
- **ReflectionResponses** — learner answers to structured metacognitive prompts
- **AuditLogs** — comprehensive system event logging for reproducibility and security

                       ├─ question, answer
                       └─ created_at
```

This design ensures that each learner session produces a rich, analyzable dataset that links behavior (intents, queries, revealed information) with outcomes (diagnosis accuracy, bias awareness, metacognitive reflection quality).

## State Management Architecture

During an active simulation, the **Progressive Disclosure Store** maintains session-level state in memory:

```python
class SessionState:
    session_id: str
    case_id: str
    current_phase: DiagnosticPhase  # anamnesis, exam, labs
    revealed_blocks: Set[str]        # IDs of disclosed information
    query_history: List[Query]       # All student queries
    working_hypothesis: Optional[str]  # Current diagnostic focus
    bias_warnings_triggered: List[BiasWarning]
    start_time: datetime
```

This in-memory state enables rapid decision-making during interactions (milliseconds, not database query latency). However, key pedagogical events trigger immediate database writes through event hooks:

```python
@on_reveal
def handle_information_revealed(block: InformationBlock):
    update_session_state(block)
    log_to_database(
        event="discovery",
        category=block.category,
        label=block.label,
        value=block.content,
        block_id=block.id,
        timestamp=now()
    )

@on_bias_detected
def handle_bias_detected(bias_type: str, description: str):
    issue_warning(bias_type)
    log_to_database(
        event="bias_warning",
        bias_type=bias_type,
        description=description,
        timestamp=now()
    )
```

This event-driven design ensures that cognitive bias detection (Chapter 2) and reflection prompts are not only experienced by the learner but also captured for empirical study (addressing gaps identified in Chapter 3).

## Choice of Database Technology

For research purposes, **portability and reproducibility** were prioritized over scalability. SQLite was selected because it:

- **Allows easy sharing** of complete simulation datasets for replication studies (single-file database)
- **Eliminates external dependencies** for participants in multi-site trials
- **Guarantees data integrity** even during abrupt session terminations (ACID compliance)
- **Simplifies deployment** — no separate database server required
- **Ensures reproducibility** — exact database state can be versioned and shared

Although SQLite does not support massive concurrency, SmartDoc's use case involves individual or small-cohort learning sessions, making this a pragmatic and effective choice. The abstraction layer (SQLAlchemy) ensures that the system can migrate to enterprise-grade databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) if future large-scale deployments require it.

## Logging and Reproducibility

SmartDoc implements structured logging for both technical and pedagogical events. For each session, the following are captured:

**Interaction Traces:**
- Learner queries with exact timestamps
- Classified intents with confidence scores and explanations
- Information blocks revealed with revelation sequences
- Response content from each responder module

**Pedagogical Events:**
- Discovery events organized by category (presenting_symptoms, physical_examination, diagnostic_results, current_medications, imaging)
- Bias warnings with type, timing, and contextual triggers
- Reflection prompt presentations and student responses
- Diagnosis submissions with complete evaluation breakdowns

**Technical Metrics:**
- LLM inference times and token counts
- Classification confidence distributions
- Fallback mechanism activations
- Error occurrences and recovery strategies

These logs create a **complete reasoning trace**, enabling:

1. **Formative feedback** — personalized debriefs showing learners their questioning patterns, revealed information sequence, and bias-prone moments

2. **Summative evaluation** — objective assessment of diagnostic accuracy, information gathering thoroughness, and bias awareness

3. **Research analytics** — large-scale studies of interaction patterns, identification of common reasoning errors, and evaluation of pedagogical interventions

By embedding reproducibility at the data layer, SmartDoc ensures that each learning session doubles as a research opportunity. This addresses the call in Chapter 3 for more transparent and empirically grounded evaluation of AI-powered virtual patients.

    "total_bias_warnings": 1,
    "discoveries_by_category": {
      "presenting_symptoms": 6,
      "current_medications": 3,
      "physical_examination": 3,
      "imaging": 3,
      "diagnostic_results": 3
    },
    "session_duration_minutes": 20.7
  }
}
```

This structured capture enables both immediate educational use (student review, instructor feedback) and downstream research analysis (pattern mining, intervention effectiveness studies).

## Data Privacy and Security Considerations

Although SmartDoc is a research prototype, data protection principles were embedded from initial design:

**Access Control:**
- Role-based authentication (students, instructors, administrators)
- Session isolation — learners access only their own data
- Instructor dashboards with aggregated analytics

**Data Minimization:**
- No personally identifiable medical information
- Simulated cases only (no real patient data)
- Optional anonymization for research datasets

**Audit Trails:**
- All data access logged with timestamps and user IDs
- Administrative actions (user creation, data export) fully traced
- Modification history preserved for critical records

**Local Storage:**
- All data stored locally, no external transmission
- LLM processing entirely local (Ollama), no cloud API calls
- Database backups encrypted at rest

These safeguards align with educational research ethics requirements and demonstrate that pedagogical innovation need not compromise learner privacy.
# 4.2.5 Deployment Configuration and Scalability

A critical requirement for SmartDoc is reliable deployment in both research and educational settings. The deployment architecture was designed with three guiding principles:

1. **Reproducibility** — ensuring that the same configuration can be reproduced across different sites and machines
2. **Scalability** — enabling the platform to support cohorts of learners by scaling model inference capacity when needed
3. **Accessibility** — minimizing technical barriers for institutions, favoring lightweight setups that do not require specialized infrastructure

## Containerization and Reproducibility

To guarantee consistent behavior across environments, the system is distributed as containerized services using Docker. This encapsulation ensures that all dependencies are versioned and portable, allowing educational institutions or research collaborators to reproduce experiments without lengthy installation procedures.

**Table 4.6: Docker Container Components**

| Component | Technology | Role | Configuration |
|-----------|-----------|------|---------------|
| Web Application | Flask + Gunicorn | HTTP server for API and static files | 4 worker processes, port 8000 |
| LLM Inference | Ollama | Local model hosting with GPU acceleration | Gemma 3:4b-it-q4_K_M loaded in memory |
| Database | SQLite | Persistent storage with ACID guarantees | Single-file, ~50MB typical size |
| CORS Middleware | Flask-CORS | Cross-origin request support | Development frontend access enabled |
| Logging System | Python logging | Structured audit trail | JSON format, daily rotation, 7-day retention |

### Container Definition

The primary application container is built on `python:3.13-slim` base image and includes:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    gcc \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Ollama
RUN curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Install Python dependencies via Poetry
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN pip install poetry && poetry install --no-root --no-dev

# Copy application code
COPY apps/api /app/api
COPY packages/ /app/packages

# Expose ports
EXPOSE 8000

# Startup script
CMD ["./start.sh"]
```

### Startup Sequence

The container initialization follows a deterministic sequence to ensure all components are operational before accepting requests:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# start.sh

# 1. Start Ollama service in background
ollama serve &

# 2. Wait for Ollama to be ready
sleep 5

# 3. Load LLM models into memory
ollama pull gemma3:4b-it-q4_K_M

# 4. Initialize database (run migrations)
cd /app/api
poetry run alembic upgrade head

# 5. Start Flask application via Gunicorn
poetry run gunicorn \
    --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 \
    --workers 4 \
    --timeout 120 \
    --access-logfile /app/logs/access.log \
    --error-logfile /app/logs/error.log \
    smartdoc_api:app
```

This sequence ensures that LLM models are pre-loaded (avoiding cold-start latency during first student query) and the database schema is current.

## Model Hosting and Flexibility

SmartDoc supports two deployment modes to accommodate different institutional contexts:

### Local Hosting (Research/Privacy-Focused)

**Configuration:**
- Ollama running within the application container
- Gemma 3:4b quantized model (~3GB memory)
- GPU acceleration via NVIDIA Container Toolkit (optional but recommended)
- No internet connectivity required after initial model download

**Advantages:**
- Complete data privacy (no external API calls)
- Reproducible model behavior (fixed version)
- No API costs
- Suitable for research studies requiring exact replication

**Limitations:**
- Requires capable hardware (8GB+ RAM, GPU recommended)
- Lower accuracy than state-of-the-art commercial models
- Self-managed updates and maintenance

### Cloud Hosting (Production-Scale)

**Configuration:**
- Provider abstraction switched to OpenAI or Anthropic
- API keys managed via environment variables
- Model selection: GPT-4o-mini or Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Rate limiting and cost controls enabled

**Advantages:**
- State-of-the-art model performance
- No local hardware requirements
- Automatic scaling
- Professional reliability and uptime

**Limitations:**
- API costs per inference
- Data transmitted to external services
- Potential latency from network round-trips
- Model updates may change behavior

The dual-mode design reflects a balance between cost, accuracy, and data governance, allowing institutions to select the configuration best suited to their pedagogical and ethical context.

## Scalability Considerations

Although individual learners typically interact with SmartDoc in isolation, classroom or cohort settings require concurrent session support. The architecture supports horizontal scaling through several mechanisms:

### Application Scaling

Gunicorn worker processes enable concurrent request handling:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  smartdoc-api:
    build: .
    environment:
      GUNICORN_WORKERS: 4  # Adjust based on CPU cores
      GUNICORN_TIMEOUT: 120
    deploy:
      replicas: 2  # Multiple container instances
```

### LLM Inference Scaling

For local deployment, multiple Ollama instances can be launched in parallel:

```yaml
services:
  ollama-1:
    image: ollama/ollama
    ports: ["11434:11434"]
    
  ollama-2:
    image: ollama/ollama
    ports: ["11435:11434"]
    
  smartdoc-api:
    environment:
      OLLAMA_HOSTS: "http://ollama-1:11434,http://ollama-2:11434"
```

Load balancing distributes inference requests across instances, reducing wait times.

### Database Considerations

SQLite is sufficient for cohorts up to ~50 concurrent users. For larger deployments, migration to PostgreSQL is straightforward via SQLAlchemy:

```python
# Minimal configuration change
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///smartdoc.db")
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
```

PostgreSQL supports thousands of concurrent connections and enables distributed deployments across multiple servers.

## Persistent Storage and Operational Logging

Two Docker volumes ensure data persistence across container restarts:

```yaml
volumes:
  smartdoc-data:
    # Database files, session state
    driver: local
    
  smartdoc-logs:
    # Application logs, audit trails
    driver: local
```

### Database Volume

Stores the complete SQLite database file. Backed up automatically via cron job every 24 hours:

```bash
# Backup script
#!/bin/bash
timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
cp /app/data/smartdoc.db /app/backups/smartdoc_$timestamp.db
# Retain last 7 backups
ls -t /app/backups/smartdoc_*.db | tail -n +8 | xargs rm -f
```

### Logs Volume

Gathers comprehensive operational logs:

- **Application logs** — Flask route handling, request/response cycles
- **LLM inference logs** — prompt/completion pairs, inference times, token counts
- **Error traces** — stack traces, exception contexts, recovery actions
- **Audit logs** — user authentication, data access, administrative actions

Log files are structured JSON for machine parsing:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T22:47:52.289182Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "module": "intent_classifier",
  "event": "classification_success",
  "data": {
    "query": "What is her past medical history?",
    "intent": "pmh_general",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "inference_time_ms": 234
  }
}
```

This enables programmatic analysis of system behavior and identification of performance bottlenecks.

## Educational Impact of Deployment Design

By prioritizing reproducibility and portability, SmartDoc enables institutions to adopt the platform with minimal setup, making bias-aware clinical simulation accessible beyond well-resourced centers. The containerization approach means that:

- **Technical staff** can deploy SmartDoc with a single `docker-compose up` command
- **Researchers** can replicate study environments exactly across multiple sites
- **Educators** can run the system on laptops for small workshops or on servers for entire courses

The scalability features ensure that response times remain low (<2 seconds per interaction), preserving immersion and educational value even with larger groups. The emphasis on local deployment and data privacy reinforces trust in the system for formal training contexts.

Together, these deployment choices demonstrate that architectural decisions are not merely technical concerns but **educational enablers**, supporting widespread adoption and rigorous empirical evaluation of diagnostic reasoning pedagogy.
# 4.2.6 User Interfaces

SmartDoc's user-facing components translate the technical architecture into accessible, pedagogically effective interfaces. The design philosophy prioritizes **cognitive focus** over visual complexity—students should concentrate on clinical reasoning rather than navigating complex software. This section describes the two primary interfaces: the simulation environment for students and the administrative dashboard for educators.

## 4.2.6.1 Simulation Interface

The simulation interface presents as a single-page web application accessible through any modern browser. The design deliberately avoids medical record system mimicry, instead providing a clean, distraction-free environment that foregrounds diagnostic thinking.

### Layout and Core Components

**Three-Panel Organization:**

1. **Patient Information Panel** (left, 25% width)

   - Case title and chief complaint
   - Basic demographics and presenting context
   - Always visible for quick reference
   - Styled as a persistent sidebar

2. **Interaction Panel** (center, 50% width)

   - Chat-based conversation with the patient's son
   - Scrollable conversation history with visual distinction between student queries (right-aligned, blue) and system responses (left-aligned, gray)
   - Input field with suggestion buttons for common query types ("Ask about medications", "Request vital signs", "Order imaging")
   - Real-time typing indicators during LLM processing

3. **Discovery Panel** (right, 25% width)
   - Running list of revealed information organized by category
   - Visual indicators for critical findings (amber icon) and contradictory evidence (purple icon)
   - Bias warnings appear here as persistent cards
   - Collapsible sections to manage information density

### Tabbed Investigation Views

Below the main conversation panel, three tabs organize different types of clinical information:

**Anamnesis Tab**

- History of present illness
- Past medical history
- Current medications
- Social history
- Review of systems

Each piece of information appears only after the student asks the relevant question, with timestamps showing when it was revealed.

**Physical Examination Tab**

- Vital signs
- General appearance
- System-by-system examination findings

Examination findings populate dynamically based on student requests, mirroring real clinical workflow where you see only what you examine.

**Diagnostic Results Tab**

- Laboratory values
- Imaging reports
- Special tests (echocardiogram, etc.)

Results appear in chronological order of request, not grouped by type, reinforcing the temporal nature of diagnostic investigation.

### Bias Warning Display

When the bias detection system identifies a concerning pattern, a **bias warning card** appears in the Discovery Panel with the following structure:

```
⚠️ COGNITIVE BIAS DETECTED

Type: Anchoring Bias

Pattern: You have focused heavily on the cardiac hypothesis
after the initial chest X-ray interpretation suggested
pulmonary vascular congestion. Consider whether you are
giving sufficient weight to contradictory evidence (e.g.,
normal cardiac examination) or alternative explanations
for the patient's symptoms.

Recommendation: Before proceeding, explicitly list
evidence that DOES NOT support your current leading
diagnosis.
```

The warning remains visible but non-blocking—students can continue investigating without dismissing it. This design choice reflects the pedagogical goal of making bias awareness metacognitively salient without punishing learners or creating frustration.

### Diagnosis Submission Interface

When the student feels ready to conclude the case, clicking "Submit Diagnosis" reveals a structured form with five metacognitive prompts:

1. **What is your diagnosis?**
   Free text, allowing students to express diagnostic certainty or uncertainty naturally.

2. **What evidence most strongly supports your diagnosis?**
   Forces explicit articulation of reasoning, preventing "gut feeling" diagnoses.

3. **What evidence argues against your diagnosis?**
   Prompts consideration of contradictory data, engaging System 2 deliberation.

4. **What alternative diagnoses did you consider?**
   Assesses differential diagnosis breadth and systematic thinking.

5. **How would you rule in or rule out these alternatives?**
   Evaluates understanding of diagnostic test characteristics and clinical decision-making.

Upon submission, the interface transitions to the evaluation results view (described below).

## 4.2.6.2 Evaluation Results Interface

After diagnosis submission, students receive comprehensive feedback organized into three sections:

### Overall Performance Summary

A prominent score display shows:

- **Overall Score:** Large number (e.g., 81/100) with color coding (red <60, yellow 60-79, green ≥80)
- **Dimensional Breakdown:** Three sub-scores for Information Gathering, Diagnostic Accuracy, and Cognitive Bias Awareness
- **Performance Tier:** Text label (e.g., "Strong Performance", "Needs Improvement")

### Detailed Evaluation

**Strengths Section:**

- Bulleted list of specific things the student did well
- Quotes from their reflection responses highlighting good reasoning
- Recognition of correct diagnostic conclusions or systematic approaches

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Specific, actionable feedback on what to do differently
- Identification of missed critical findings
- Analysis of bias patterns observed in the session

**Key Recommendations:**

- 1-2 concrete strategies for future cases
- Emphasis on generalizable skills (e.g., "Implement structured medication reconciliation") rather than case-specific facts

### Session Summary Statistics

A data table showing:

- Total interactions: 17
- Information blocks revealed: 18
- Critical findings discovered: 2/2 (100%)
- Bias warnings triggered: 1
- Session duration: 18 minutes
- Average response time: <2 seconds

This quantitative summary helps students understand their investigation pattern and efficiency.

## 4.2.6.3 Administrative Dashboard

The administrative interface provides educators and researchers with comprehensive system management capabilities. Access is restricted via authentication (simple password protection in the research prototype, designed for easy extension to institutional SSO). The dashboard is organized into six primary functional areas.

### Database Backup and Management

**Database Download:**
- One-click download of complete SQLite database file
- Includes all user sessions, conversations, diagnoses, and evaluations
- Enables offline analysis and data archival
- Critical for research data preservation and institutional backup policies

This backup capability ensures that research data remains accessible even if the hosted instance becomes unavailable, supporting reproducibility requirements for academic research.

### System Configuration

**Bias Warning and Discovery Counter Visibility:**

A critical feature for research studies is the ability to control the visibility of metacognitive scaffolding elements:

- **Hide Bias Warnings:** Checkbox to suppress real-time cognitive bias alerts
- **Hide Discovery Counters:** Checkbox to conceal information revelation tracking

**Implementation:**
```html
<input type="checkbox" id="hide-bias-warnings" />
Hide Bias Warnings (for research studies)
```

When enabled, the configuration is stored server-side via `/api/v1/config` endpoint and retrieved by the simulation interface on load. The frontend then:

1. Hides all elements with class `bias-related` (discovery counters, bias warning cards)
2. Prevents bias warning popups from appearing
3. Logs all suppressed warnings to browser console for debugging
4. Continues recording bias events in the database for analysis

**Research Rationale:**  
This feature enables controlled experiments comparing diagnostic performance with and without metacognitive scaffolding. By hiding bias warnings from a control group while maintaining identical case difficulty, researchers can isolate the educational impact of real-time bias feedback. All bias events remain logged in the database regardless of visibility, ensuring complete data collection for both experimental conditions.

### Users Management

**User Creation:**
- Form-based user registration with required fields:
  - Display name and email
  - Age and sex (for demographic analysis)
  - Role (user/admin)
  - Medical experience level (student, resident, attending)
  - Label/cohort identifier (e.g., "pilot", "cohort-2024")
- Automatic generation of unique access code for authentication
- Access code displayed once immediately after creation

**User Administration:**
- Table view showing all registered users with:
  - User ID, name, email, and role
  - Account status (active/inactive)
  - Usage statistics (number of sessions completed)
  - Creation timestamp
- Actions: View details, deactivate/reactivate, delete user
- Sortable and filterable by any column

**Purpose:**  
This management interface supports both educational deployment (creating student accounts) and research administration (organizing participants into cohorts, tracking completion rates).

### LLM Profile Configuration

**Profile Creation:**
- Define multiple LLM configurations for different use cases
- Configuration parameters:
  - Profile name (e.g., "Default GPT-4", "Research Gemma")
  - Provider selection (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - Model specification (e.g., "gemma3:4b-it-q4_K_M")
  - Temperature (0.0-2.0, controlling response creativity)
  - Top-p sampling parameter (0.0-1.0)
  - Max tokens (optional response length limit)
  - Default profile designation

**Profile Management:**
- Table view showing all configured LLM profiles
- Displays: ID, name, provider, model, temperature, top-p settings
- Indicates which profile is currently default
- Actions: Edit parameters, set as default, delete profile

**Use Cases:**
- **Production:** Stable, tested model configuration
- **Experimentation:** Testing new models or parameter combinations
- **A/B Testing:** Comparing different LLM configurations with identical prompts
- **Cost Optimization:** Switching between local (Ollama) and cloud providers

### Agent Prompt Management

**Prompt Creation:**
- Select agent type (Son/Patient Translator, Resident/Medical Assistant, Exam/Objective Findings)
- Associate with specific LLM profile or leave as "Default/Any"
- Text area for complete system prompt definition
- Automatic versioning of prompt iterations

**Prompt Administration:**
- Table view showing all agent prompts with:
  - Prompt ID and agent type
  - Associated LLM profile
  - Version number (automatically incremented)
  - Status (active/inactive)
  - Creation and last update timestamps
- Actions: View full prompt text, edit, activate/deactivate, delete

**Prompt Viewer Modal:**
- Detailed view displaying:
  - Agent type, LLM profile, version, status
  - Complete prompt text with syntax highlighting
  - Creation and update history
- Enables comparison between prompt versions for iterative refinement

**Research Application:**  
This feature enables systematic evaluation of different prompt engineering strategies. Researchers can test how variations in agent instructions affect response quality, maintaining version control of all prompt iterations used in published studies.

### Recent Activity Log

**Activity Monitoring:**
- Chronological table of recent administrative actions
- Logged events include:
  - User creation, modification, deletion
  - LLM profile configuration changes
  - Agent prompt updates
  - System configuration modifications
- Each entry shows:
  - Timestamp of action
  - Administrator user who performed action
  - Action type and description
  - Relevant details (e.g., which user was modified)

**Purpose:**  
Provides audit trail for research governance, troubleshooting system issues, and understanding usage patterns. Critical for institutional review board (IRB) compliance and research reproducibility documentation.

## 4.2.6.4 Design Rationale

### Minimalist Aesthetic

SmartDoc deliberately avoids elaborate graphics, animations, or complex navigation. This **cognitive minimalism** reflects educational research showing that extraneous visual elements can increase cognitive load and distract from learning objectives (Mayer's Coherence Principle, multimedia learning research).

**Design Choices:**

- White background with subtle gray panels
- Single clear font (system default sans-serif)
- Minimal color use (blue for user, gray for system, amber/purple for warnings)
- No background images or decorative elements

### Conversation-Centric Interaction

The chat-based interface mirrors familiar messaging applications, reducing the cognitive cost of learning to use the system. Students focus on **what to ask** rather than **how to ask it**, aligning with the pedagogical goal of improving clinical reasoning rather than software proficiency.

**Affordances:**

- Natural language input (no rigid command syntax)
- Suggestion buttons for common queries (scaffolding for novices)
- Persistent conversation history (supports System 2 reflection)
- Real-time feedback (maintains immersion)

### Transparent Discovery Tracking

Unlike traditional case simulations where students might wonder "did I miss something?", SmartDoc's Discovery Panel provides immediate feedback about information revelation. This transparency serves two educational purposes:

1. **Reduces anxiety:** Students know when they've discovered new information
2. **Encourages persistence:** Visual accumulation of discoveries rewards thorough investigation

The design makes **what you know** and **what you still need to learn** explicit, supporting metacognitive monitoring.

### Non-Punitive Bias Warnings

The bias warning system could have been designed to penalize students (e.g., score deductions) or block progression (e.g., forced acknowledgment). Instead, warnings appear as **informational advisories** that remain visible but non-blocking.

**Rationale:**

- Bias awareness is developmental—students need multiple exposures to recognize patterns
- Punishment could discourage hypothesis formation (reducing bias by eliminating thinking)
- Persistent visibility allows students to reflect on warnings after the fact

This design reflects a **formative assessment philosophy** where mistakes are learning opportunities rather than failures to be avoided.

### Structured Reflection Prompts

The five-question diagnosis submission form operationalizes metacognitive reflection without requiring students to understand cognitive psychology theory. Each prompt targets a specific aspect of diagnostic reasoning:

- **Question 1** (diagnosis): Decision-making
- **Question 2** (supporting evidence): Evidence integration
- **Question 3** (contradictory evidence): Bias awareness
- **Question 4** (alternatives): Differential diagnosis
- **Question 5** (ruling in/out): Diagnostic strategy

This structure ensures students engage System 2 deliberation regardless of their natural reflective tendency, addressing the problem that unreflective practitioners often don't know they need to reflect.

## 4.2.6.5 Implementation Details

### Frontend Technology

The simulation interface is implemented as a **static single-page application** using vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules), HTML5, and CSS3. This architecture choice prioritizes:

- **Simplicity:** No build step or framework dependencies
- **Portability:** Runs on any web server (including `python -m http.server`)
- **Transparency:** Source code is human-readable for educational inspection
- **Performance:** Minimal bundle size, fast load times

**Module Organization:**

```
js/
├── config.js          # API endpoint configuration
├── api.js             # Backend communication layer
├── state.js           # Application state management
├── main.js            # Initialization and routing
└── ui/

    ├── discoveries.js  # Information tracking panel
    ├── results.js      # Evaluation display
    └── tabs.js         # Anamnesis/Exam/Labs tabs
```

### Responsive Design

The interface adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop (≥1200px):** Three-panel layout as described
- **Tablet (768-1199px):** Two-panel layout with collapsible patient info
- **Mobile (<768px):** Single-panel stacked layout with tab navigation

This responsiveness supports both classroom use (desktop monitors) and remote learning (laptops, tablets).

### Accessibility Considerations

While not the primary focus of the research prototype, basic accessibility features include:

- Semantic HTML (proper heading hierarchy, ARIA labels)
- Keyboard navigation support (tab order, enter to submit)
- High-contrast text (WCAG AA compliance)
- Screen reader compatibility for core content

Future production deployment would require comprehensive accessibility audit and remediation to meet institutional standards.

---

The user interface design reflects SmartDoc's core pedagogical philosophy: **make cognitive processes visible, support metacognitive reflection, and minimize extraneous cognitive load**. These principles translate technical capability into educational impact, completing the bridge between AI-powered backend systems and meaningful learning experiences for medical students.
# 4.3 Example Workflow: The Miliary Tuberculosis Case

This section illustrates a complete diagnostic workflow through SmartDoc using real session data (Session SESS_0W451OZEJ, conducted October 13, 2025). This case demonstrates how the system's design principles translate into educational practice, showing the interplay between intent classification, progressive disclosure, educational scaffolding, bias detection, and metacognitive evaluation.

## 4.3.1 Case Overview and Educational Objectives

The case adapts Mull et al.'s published example of diagnostic error, where an elderly Spanish-speaking woman with dyspnea was repeatedly misdiagnosed with heart failure due to cognitive biases. SmartDoc transforms this case report into an interactive learning experience that makes bias tangible and addressable.

**Initial Presentation:**
> "A 65-year-old woman presents with worsening shortness of breath over 2 months. Her son provides the history. She has a history of 'heart failure.'"

**Educational Objectives:**
1. Practice systematic information gathering across history, examination, and investigations
2. Recognize anchoring bias (initial "heart failure" framing)
3. Demonstrate medication reconciliation in complex patients
4. Integrate contradictory evidence (normal echo vs. elevated BNP)
5. Identify the critical diagnostic clue (immunosuppressant use)

**Correct Diagnosis:** Miliary tuberculosis secondary to TNF-α inhibitor therapy

**Common Misdiagnosis:** Acute heart failure exacerbation (anchoring trap)

## 4.3.2 Phase-by-Phase Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Anamnesis (Interactions 1-10, Duration: 7 minutes)

The student begins systematic history-taking, demonstrating generally good clinical reasoning:

**Interaction 1 — Past Medical History**

> Student: "First, what is her past medical history?"  
> Intent: `pmh_general` (confidence 0.95)  
> Son: "Uh, she has a history of morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis."

**Discovery Event:** Block `pmh_comorbidities` revealed (category: presenting_symptoms)

The student appropriately begins with foundational information. The rheumatoid arthritis mention is critical but does not immediately reveal the connection to immunosuppressant therapy.

**Interaction 2 — Chief Complaint**

> Student: "And what brings you here today?"  
> Intent: `hpi_chief_complaint` (confidence 0.95)  
> Son: "Uh, she's been having trouble breathing, especially when she's trying to do things. And she has a cough, but it's not bringing up anything."

**Discovery Event:** Block `hpi_dyspnea_details` revealed

**Interaction 3 — Symptom Duration**

> Student: "For how long is she having trouble breathing?"  
> Intent: `hpi_onset_duration_primary` (confidence 0.95)  
> Son: "Uh, it's been gradually worsening for about two months, you know? It hasn't gotten suddenly worse, just slowly."

**Discovery Event:** Block `hpi_onset_duration` revealed

The gradual two-month progression argues against acute cardiac decompensation, though many students do not recognize this initially.

**Interaction 4 — Current Medications**

> Student: "Any regular medication?"  
> Intent: `meds_current_known` (confidence 0.95)  
> Son: "Uh, she's currently taking lisinopril, atenolol, glipizide, and metformin, I think. I'm not sure about anything else she might be on."

**Discovery Event:** Block `meds_initial_known` revealed (Level 1)

Note the son's uncertainty ("I think", "I'm not sure about anything else"), which models realistic family member recall and foreshadows the need for deeper medication reconciliation.

**Critical Interaction 5 — RA Medications (First Attempt)**

> Student: "And is she taking anything for her rheumatoid arthritis?"  
> Intent: `meds_ra_specific_initial_query` (confidence 0.98)  
> Son: "Uh, I'm not sure I have information about that specifically. I don't have records of what she's taking for her rheumatoid arthritis, I'm sorry."

**Discovery Event:** Block `meds_ra_uncertainty` revealed (Level 2)

This response creates productive frustration—the student recognizes that RA treatment information exists but is not immediately available. The system is testing whether the learner will persist.

**Interactions 6-8 — Constitutional Symptoms**

The student systematically evaluates constitutional symptoms:

> "Does she have fevers?" → No (`hpi_fever`)  
> "What about night chills?" → No (`hpi_chills`)  
> "Any pain? On the chest?" → No (`hpi_chest_pain`)

**Discovery Events:** Three pertinent negative blocks revealed

This thorough evaluation of negatives demonstrates good clinical reasoning. However, the absence of fever and chills may inappropriately reduce suspicion for infectious etiology (tuberculosis can present without fever).

### Phase 2: Physical Examination (Interactions 9-11, Duration: 3 minutes)

**Interaction 9 — Vital Signs**

> Student: "Vital signs"  
> Intent: `exam_vital` (confidence 0.95)  
> System: "Vital signs: Temperature 99.9°F (37.7°C), HR 105, BP 140/70, RR 24, O2 sat 89% on room air."

**Discovery Event:** Block `exam_vital` revealed

The low-grade temperature (99.9°F) and hypoxia (89% O2) are concerning but nonspecific. Many students fixate on the tachycardia and hypertension, reinforcing cardiac hypotheses.

**Interaction 10 — Cardiac Examination**

> Student: "cardiac sound"  
> Intent: `exam_cardiovascular` (confidence 0.98)  
> System: "Heart sounds are normal and there is no lower-extremity edema."

**Discovery Event:** Block `exam_cardiac_negative` revealed

Normal cardiac examination is actually **contradictory evidence** against heart failure, though students often overlook this.

**Interaction 11 — Pulmonary Examination**

> Student: "lung sounds"  
> Intent: `exam_respiratory` (confidence 0.98)  
> System: "Pulmonary examination demonstrates crackles in all lung fields."

**Discovery Event:** Block `exam_respiratory` revealed

Diffuse crackles can occur in both pulmonary edema (heart failure) and interstitial lung disease (including miliary TB). This finding is ambiguous.

### Phase 3: Investigations (Interactions 12-17, Duration: 8 minutes)

**Interaction 12 — Initial Imaging (ANCHORING TRAP)**

> Student: "is there any chest x-ray?"  
> Intent: `imaging_chest_xray` (confidence 0.95)  
> System: "Yes, a preliminary chest radiograph was obtained. The interpretation is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion."

**Discovery Event:** Block `imaging_cxr_preliminary` revealed  
**BIAS TRIGGER ACTIVATED:** Anchoring on "pulmonary vascular congestion" → heart failure hypothesis

**Bias Warning #1 Triggered** (timestamp: 22:53:42)  
Type: Anchoring  
Description: "Focus on cardiac hypothesis after chest X-ray interpretation"

The preliminary radiology interpretation creates a powerful anchor. Many students stop investigating at this point, having "confirmed" their heart failure hypothesis.

**Critical Interaction 13 — Medication Reconciliation (Second Attempt)**

> Student: "Are you sure that your mother is not on any biologics or immunosuppressive medications?"  
> Intent: `meds_ra_specific_initial_query` (confidence 0.95)

**Educational Scaffold Deployed:**

> Son: "Like I said, I'm not sure about her rheumatoid arthritis medications. **Maybe you could check her previous hospital records?** I know she's had some treatments at other facilities."

This is the second attempt with similar intent, triggering the educational hint mechanism. The system guides the student toward medication reconciliation **without revealing the answer**.

**Critical Interaction 14 — Medication Reconciliation (Success!)**

> Student: "Can you get her complete medication list from previous hospitalizations?"  
> Intent: `meds_full_reconciliation_query` (confidence 0.98)  
> Son: "Uh, yes, she was receiving **infliximab** for rheumatoid arthritis. That's the only medication listed from her previous hospital stays, as far as I know."

**Discovery Event:** Block `critical_infliximab` revealed (Level 3, **critical finding**)

**This is the diagnostic key.** Infliximab (TNF-α inhibitor) substantially increases tuberculosis reactivation risk. Students who reach this information are significantly more likely to arrive at the correct diagnosis.

**Interaction 15 — Advanced Imaging**

> Student: "Can we have a computed tomography scan?"  
> Intent: `imaging_ct_chest` (confidence 0.95)  
> System: "The chest X-ray demonstrates a reticular pattern with innumerable, tiny, 1- to 2-mm pulmonary nodules. We can order a computed tomography scan of the chest to further characterize these findings. Would you like me to proceed with that order?"

**Discovery Event:** Block `critical_ct_chest` revealed (re-interpretation of imaging)

The system reveals that the CT shows **miliary nodules** (1-2mm), not simple vascular congestion. This is **contradictory evidence** that should prompt reconsideration of the heart failure hypothesis.

**Interaction 16 — Laboratory Studies**

> Student: "Bloodwork?"  
> Intent: `labs_general` (confidence 0.95)  
> System: "The cardiac lab results show a pro-BNP level greater than the upper limit of normal. We also have an elevated white blood cell count of 13.0 x 10^9/L and a low hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL. I recommend further investigation into the etiology of the anemia and leukocytosis."

**Discovery Events:** Blocks `labs_bnp`, `labs_wbc`, `labs_hemoglobin` revealed

The elevated BNP is a **red herring** that reinforces the cardiac hypothesis, while the leukocytosis actually suggests infection/inflammation.

**Interaction 17 — Echocardiogram (CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE)**

> Student: "Echocardiogram?"  
> Intent: `imaging_echo` (confidence 0.95)  
> System: "The echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction with no evidence of elevated filling pressures."

**Discovery Event:** Block `critical_echo` revealed (**contradicts heart failure**)

**This is the decisive contradictory finding.** Normal ejection fraction and filling pressures effectively rule out heart failure as the primary cause of dyspnea. Students who integrate this evidence correctly will abandon the cardiac hypothesis.

### Summary of Information Revealed

**Table 4.7: Discoveries by Category and Timing**

| Category | Count | Critical Findings | Timeline |
|----------|-------|------------------|----------|
| Presenting Symptoms | 6 | None | First 2 minutes |
| Current Medications | 3 | Infliximab (min 7) | Throughout anamnesis |
| Physical Examination | 3 | None | Minutes 7-10 |
| Imaging | 3 | Miliary nodules, Normal echo | Minutes 10-15 |
| Diagnostic Results | 3 | None (BNP is misleading) | Minutes 15-18 |
| **Total** | **18** | **2 critical** | **18 minutes** |

## 4.3.3 Diagnosis and Reflection

After completing the investigation, the student submitted:

**Diagnosis:** "miliary tuberculosis"

**Reflection Responses:**

1. **Most compelling evidence:**
   > "The chest CT showing tiny pulmonary nodules in a diffuse reticular pattern, in combination with the patient's recent infliximab therapy, is the most compelling evidence supporting miliary tuberculosis. This imaging pattern is classic for disseminated hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and TNF alpha inhibitor therapy significantly increases the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis."

2. **Evidence against diagnosis:**
   > "An elevated BNP and crackles on auscultation could suggest heart failure but these findings are nonspecific and can occur in many conditions involving lung parenchymal disease or inflammation. The absence of peripheral edema and the normal cardiac exam make a cardiac origin of her dyspnea unlikely."

3. **Alternative diagnoses:**
   > "Acute heart failure exacerbation; Interstitial lung disease (possibly secondary to rheumatoid arthritis or drug toxicity)"

4. **How to rule in/out alternatives:**
   > "The echocardiogram evaluating left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, as well as filling pressures, would decisively clarify whether cardiac dysfunction explains the symptoms. In this case, the normal ejection fraction and absence of elevated filling pressures effectively rule out acute heart failure as the cause of dyspnea."

5. **Must-not-miss conditions considered:**
   > "I considered and systematically excluded acute heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and severe bacterial pneumonia. The chronic and progressive nature of the patient's symptoms, absence of pleuritic pain or focal infiltrates, and the imaging pattern all argue against these."

## 4.3.4 Evaluation Results

**Overall Score:** 81/100

**Dimensional Scores:**
- **Information Gathering:** 75/100
- **Diagnostic Accuracy:** 88/100
- **Cognitive Bias Awareness:** 80/100

**Evaluator Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- Correct diagnosis, avoiding the heart failure trap
- Recognition of infliximab's role in TB reactivation
- Systematic exclusion of alternative diagnoses
- Good integration of contradictory evidence (normal echo)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- More explicit documentation of weight loss and constitutional symptoms
- Deeper exploration of how anchoring bias influenced initial assessment
- More detailed discussion of how to prevent similar errors in future cases

**Key Recommendation:**
> "Implement a structured approach to medication reconciliation, specifically focusing on immunosuppressant therapies and their potential impact on infectious disease risk. Develop a checklist to ensure all relevant medications are considered during the diagnostic process. Practice actively challenging initial interpretations, particularly when they are influenced by readily available data (e.g., CXR findings)."

## 4.3.5 Educational Impact Analysis

This session demonstrates several key features of SmartDoc's design:

### Progressive Disclosure Success

The student revealed 18 information blocks through 17 queries, demonstrating active information seeking rather than passive consumption. The medication reconciliation escalation (Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3) required persistence and semantic precision, rewarding expert-level inquiry behavior.

### Educational Scaffolding Effectiveness

The dynamic hint after the second RA medication query successfully guided the student toward medication reconciliation (reaching Level 3). Without this scaffold, 58% of students in pilot testing failed to discover the infliximab clue.

### Bias Demonstration

The case successfully created an anchoring opportunity (preliminary CXR interpretation suggesting heart failure). The bias warning triggered when the student focused heavily on cardiac explanations, though the student ultimately overcame the bias by pursuing additional investigations (CT, echo).

### Metacognitive Reflection Quality

The student's reflection responses demonstrate:
- **Evidence integration:** Connected infliximab to TB risk
- **Contradiction acknowledgment:** Recognized normal echo refutes heart failure
- **Alternative consideration:** Listed reasonable differential diagnoses
- **Systematic thinking:** Explained reasoning for ruling out alternatives

The quality of reflection suggests that the structured prompts successfully elicited deliberate, analytic reasoning (System 2), fulfilling the pedagogical objective of making diagnostic thinking explicit and improvable.

### System Performance

- **Intent classification:** 17/17 intents correctly classified (100%)
- **Average confidence:** 0.96 (high reliability)
- **Response latency:** <2s per interaction (maintained immersion)
- **Educational hint deployment:** 1/1 successful (student escalated appropriately)
- **Bias detection:** 1/1 trigger appropriate (anchoring correctly identified)

This case demonstrates that SmartDoc's design successfully operationalizes the principles of progressive disclosure, educational scaffolding, bias detection, and metacognitive assessment in authentic diagnostic practice.
# 4.4 Summary

This chapter has presented the complete architecture and implementation of SmartDoc, an AI-powered clinical simulation platform designed to address the cognitive bias problem identified in Chapters 2 and 3. The system represents a novel synthesis of cognitive psychology principles (dual-process theory, metacognition), artificial intelligence techniques (large language models, intent classification), and medical education pedagogy (progressive disclosure, structured reflection).

## 4.4.1 Key Contributions

### Conceptual Innovations

**Intent-Driven Progressive Disclosure**  
SmartDoc introduces a 33-intent classification system that connects student queries to information revelation dynamically. Unlike traditional static case presentations or simple keyword matching, this approach rewards semantic precision and clinical expertise, creating graduated information barriers that model real-world diagnostic uncertainty.

**Embedded Bias Detection**  
The system makes cognitive bias tangible through **bias triggers** built directly into clinical cases. Rather than explaining bias abstractly, SmartDoc creates situations where anchoring, confirmation bias, and premature closure naturally emerge, then provides real-time metacognitive prompts that make invisible reasoning processes explicit.

**Educational Scaffolding with Escalation Levels**  
The medication reconciliation example (Levels 1→2→3) demonstrates how SmartDoc guides students toward critical insights without eliminating diagnostic challenge. Dynamic hints provide just-in-time support that maintains learner agency while preventing dead ends—a balance difficult to achieve in traditional simulation designs.

### Technical Achievements

**Production-Grade LLM Integration**  
Chapter 4 documented the complete pipeline from initial prototype (57% accuracy on past medical history classification) to production deployment (95% accuracy). Key refinements included context-aware filtering, structured output parsing with retry mechanisms, and temperature optimization per module (0.3 for classification/evaluation, 0.5 for dialogue generation).

**Multi-Responder Architecture**  
The design of three specialized responders (AnamnesisSon, LabsResident, ExamObjective) demonstrates domain-specific prompt engineering that balances realism with educational value. Production refinements reduced clarification requests by 40% and eliminated 89% of strange responses while maintaining conversational authenticity.

**Comprehensive Logging for Reproducibility**  
The dual-layer state management system (session memory + event-driven logging) enables complete reasoning trace reconstruction. This design choice supports both immediate educational feedback and longitudinal research analysis, addressing a critical gap in AI-VP evaluation methodology identified in Chapter 3.

## 4.4.2 Design Principles Validated

The miliary tuberculosis case (Section 4.3) demonstrates how SmartDoc's design principles operate in authentic diagnostic practice:

1. **Authenticity:** The son persona's uncertainty ("I'm not sure", "I think") models realistic family member communication, creating genuine need for medication reconciliation rather than artificial puzzle-solving.

2. **Bias Awareness:** The preliminary chest X-ray interpretation ("pulmonary vascular congestion") creates an authentic anchoring opportunity. Students must actively challenge this interpretation rather than passively receive correct information.

3. **Structured Reflection:** The five metacognitive prompts elicited evidence-based reasoning ("The chest CT showing tiny pulmonary nodules...in combination with infliximab therapy") rather than rote recall, fulfilling Schön's vision of reflective practice in medical education.

## 4.4.3 Addressing Chapter 3 Gaps

Chapter 3 identified three major limitations in existing AI-VP research:

**Limited Evaluation Rigor**  
SmartDoc addresses this through structured diagnostic accuracy assessment (correct diagnosis, supporting evidence, alternative diagnoses), cognitive bias awareness measurement (session pattern analysis, metacognitive reflection quality), and complete session logging for reproducibility.

**Absence of Cognitive Bias Integration**  
Unlike existing AI-VPs that focus solely on knowledge transfer, SmartDoc explicitly targets dual-process reasoning. The system creates conditions where System 1 thinking leads to error (e.g., anchoring on "heart failure" framing), then provides metacognitive scaffolds that engage System 2 deliberation.

**Lack of Technical Transparency**  
This chapter provides complete algorithmic specifications (Algorithms 1-2), empirical performance data (Tables 4.2, 4.5), and production refinement documentation. Future researchers can replicate, validate, or extend SmartDoc's design based on the technical details provided.

## 4.4.4 Limitations and Design Trade-offs

### Single-Case Implementation

The current SmartDoc prototype focuses deeply on one clinical case (miliary tuberculosis). This design choice prioritizes pedagogical depth over breadth—students experience one case with comprehensive educational scaffolding rather than many cases with shallow interaction.

**Trade-off:** High educational value per case vs. limited content variety  
**Future Direction:** Template-based case authoring to enable educator-created content

### Intent Classification Constraints

The 33-intent taxonomy represents clinical reasoning comprehensively but requires maintenance as medical language evolves. Production data revealed unanticipated query phrasings ("cardiac sound" vs. "heart examination") requiring iterative refinement.

**Trade-off:** Semantic precision rewarding expertise vs. potential frustration from unrecognized intents  
**Future Direction:** Continuous learning from session logs to expand intent recognition

### LLM Dependency

SmartDoc relies on Ollama with Gemma 3:4b for all dynamic components (intent classification, response generation, diagnosis evaluation). This creates reproducibility advantages (local deployment, version control) but limits system capability to the underlying model's performance.

**Trade-off:** Local deployment and data privacy vs. state-of-the-art model performance  
**Future Direction:** Provider abstraction enables model upgrades without architectural changes

### Bias Detection Specificity

The current bias detection system focuses on three major bias types (anchoring, confirmation, premature closure) with rule-based triggers. More subtle biases (availability heuristic, representativeness) require pattern analysis difficult to implement reliably.

**Trade-off:** High-precision detection of major biases vs. incomplete coverage of all cognitive errors  
**Future Direction:** Machine learning-based bias detection trained on expert-labeled sessions

## 4.4.5 Bridge to Chapter 5

This chapter has described **what SmartDoc does** (intent-driven simulation with bias detection) and **how it works** (LLM integration, progressive disclosure, multi-responder architecture). Chapter 5 addresses the critical question: **Does it work?**

The evaluation study presents empirical evidence from 42 medical students using SmartDoc to diagnose the miliary tuberculosis case. Chapter 5 will examine:

- **Diagnostic Performance:** How many students reached the correct diagnosis vs. fell into the heart failure trap?
- **Bias Awareness:** Did metacognitive reflection improve recognition of anchoring and confirmation bias?
- **Information Gathering Quality:** Did intent-driven disclosure lead to more systematic investigations than traditional case presentations?
- **User Experience:** How did students perceive SmartDoc's educational value, realism, and usability?

Importantly, Chapter 5 will also analyze **failures**—sessions where SmartDoc did not achieve its educational objectives—to identify when and why the system's design breaks down. This critical examination will inform both the interpretation of study results and recommendations for future AI-VP development in medical education.

**Chapter 4 has established SmartDoc's theoretical foundation and technical implementation. The system now advances to empirical validation, where design principles meet the complexity of actual clinical reasoning in medical learners.**
